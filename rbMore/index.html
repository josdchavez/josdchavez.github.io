        <h3>Ladawali: More's birth and the Chabina of Viroba</h3>
        <center><image src="https://josdchavez.github.io/rbMore/images/moreposter_mahad.JPG"></center>
        <p>R.B Moré begins the narrative of his life in Ladawali during the celebration of the Chabina of Viroba, consciously intertwining geographic space and his birth with anti-caste discussion. He describes how untouchability was not practiced during this religious procession that prominently featured Mahars. The intertwinement suggests that Moré wants us to read his text as a critique of untouchability that details how he negotiated marginalization, vis-a-vis caste-class prejudice, in order to achieve a certain level of “improvement.” The alignment of his life with a critique of untouchability happens in his opening sentence: “The first capital of the Marathi state in modern times was Raaigad. It was in the village of Laadawali in the precinct of this same Raaigad that I was born, at dawn on a Sunday on the second day of the lunar month, in the year 1903 C.E. The night of the Chhabina of Viroba at Mahaad was drawing to an end” (1). The quote performs a number of symbolic associations between Moré and Ladawali that establish his authority: by saying he was born on “this same Raaigad” that was the first capital of the Marathi state, he establishes himself as an inheritor and continuator of the political centrality of Raaigad to Maharashtra in relation to Dalit activism, receiving and expanding the rich tradition of anti-caste thought in the region. Furthermore, with “The night of the Chhabina of Viroba at Mahaad was drawing to an end,” he is also associating himself with a ritual where untouchability is not salient, a trait he wants his life to be defined by, “The reason I have talked about the Chhabina of Viroba and the different gods taking part in the jatra when I told of the time of my birth, is to make it clear that people do not distinguish between touchable and untouchable on these occasions” (2).  This sentence comes before Moré’s discussion on how his father’s poverty came about, setting the tone of fervent critique that imbues the rest of the memoir.</p>
	<p> The decision to start his memoir with the Chabina of Viroba, however, offers us the possibility of looking at the absence of untouchability during the procession from a perspective that is not only because of religious practice but also because of spatial organization. If the procession is anything like it is practiced today (see the “Ladawali: Chabina of Viroba” marker on the map), one can see that the density of people that attend and the need to walk through a space that can only hold a limited amount of bodies would have made it quite difficult for untouchability to be maintained. Just how in Bombay during this time period rural, Dalit migrants escaped untouchability due to the constraints of the infrastructures of transportation and communication that forced bodies to be in close proximity of each other, the lack of untouchability in the procession might also relate to space itself. My intention behind this suggestion is not to discredit Moré; it is to introduce the manner in which this mapping project will be reading the text in order to see beyond the author's conscious weaving of the text. Looking at spatial organization allows us to ask: How is the logic of urbanization that Moré is a part of (given his constant migration across villages and the city of Bombay) allowing him to combat precarity while simultaneously appropriating his actions and entrenching the conditions of marginalization the memoir is so explicitly against? How can a visualization of More’s memoir as a proxy for the dynamics of rural-urban migration help us see not only the dispossession of people from rural land but how their actions become appropriated for the reproduction of marginalization and its implied socioeconomic relations? </p>

        <h3>Dasgaon and Dapoli</h3>
        <center><image src="https://josdchavez.github.io/rbMore/images/mahar_army.jpg"></center>
        <p>Some might argue against my decision to prominently feature the issue of urbanization in relation to this memoir given that it might appear anachronistic to the text and an issue that I’m imposing on it. However, if urbanization is understood how Neil Brenner defines it in “Theses of Urbanization” as a process of "creatively destructive patterning of modern sociospatial landscapes" that is predicated upon the dispossession of people from rural land, one recognizes the memoir’s potential to offer a view of how this creative destructive pattern takes place at the level of the everyday. Moré explains that the conditions of poverty that forced him and his family to move happened when moneylenders from Dasgaon tricked his father into giving them their land: “The moneylender sweet-talked him into signing a blank piece of paper, and then he wrote on it that my father had sold his land. Of course the moneylender became owner of that land, and my father, the former owner, became a mere tenant. Inevitably then, it was up to the landowner’s whim whether he would allow my father to go on working the land as a tenant, and in the end the expected happened. One day the moneylender evicted my father from that land for good, and he was obliged to live the painful life of a landless labourer. This happened when my father’s death was two or three years away” (3). The moneylenders stole from the Moré family to turn the land into “private property” that a proper subject, i.e. a subject willing to pay, could own. More's previous symbolic association between himself, land and anti-caste thought allows the reader to easily associate this episode, symbolically, with primitive accumulation. Moré’s explanation on the importance of Dasgaon and Dapoli for Mahars also shows how primitive accumulation might have allowed Mahars in the region to reach high levels of economic achievement. Dapoli was inhabited mostly by powerful Mahars who had obtain their wealth and social capital after serving in the army, it is very close to Dasgaon, which is were many Mahars would move after living in Dapoli: “With Dasgaon already having the strength of local unity, and with the support of high-ranked military officers who were also their brethren, nobody would dare to cross them, or have the nerve to take away the rights that they had attained. The (Mahar) people of Dasgaon broke the restrictions of religion and tradition to build large houses and wear fine clothes and ornaments. They obtained school education and acquired high government posts” (5). The army was a way through which Mahars from the area could improve their economic situation, it can even be seen as a symbiotic relationship from the postcard embedded on the Dapoli marker. Thus Dasgaon represents a contradiction within the (spatial) text: it is both an origin point for More’s poverty but also for Mahar economic realization.  He even goes to school in Dasgaon because no other school in the region will accept Mahars due to the taboo of untouchability. The urbanization of Dasgaon is what took the Moré family land but it is also what allowed material conditions of (relative) prosperity. It can thus be understood as that non-place that allows More’s narrative to have a beginning, to have a chronology to his caste critique that gains recognition as history.Bhabha explains the importance of the non-place via de Certeau: “In order to appear as material or empirical reality, the historical or social process must pass through an aesthetic alienation or privatization of its public visibility. The discourse of the social then finds its means of representation in a kind of unconsciousness” (143). This “unconsciousness” Bhabha later links to a non-place, “Beginnings require an originary non-place, something unspoken which then produces a chronology of events. Beginnings can, in this sense, be the narrative limits of the knowable, the margins of the meaningful” (146). It is the project of this map to read for that non-place beginning, to discern how urbanization haunts Moré, how it allows him certain degree of success while also appropriating his actions and reproducing the conditions of marginalization at a systematic level. </p>

        <h3>Alibag</h3>
        <center><image src="https://josdchavez.github.io/rbMore/images/mahad_satyagraha.jpg"></center>
        <p>Moré receives his education in Dasgaon until he travels to Alibag for an examination that earns him a 3 year scholarship at an English school in Mahad. If Moré’s successful academic career is to be understood as the way he successfully combatted untouchability early in his life, one must acknowledge how much this success depended on the social relations around him, especially with others Mahars. He describes how he was sent to Alibag for this examination by one of his teachers, ”a Brahman called Ramchandra Keshav Khare” (8) who did not practice untouchability and who would visit him when he was ill. To buy appropriate clothing to take the exam, he goes to Tale accompanied by a maternal cousin of his father and to get to Alibag he goes on a 3 day journey on foot with his cousin Namdeo who “knew everything we needed to know…how long it would take to reach Alibag and by which route, and also when the examination was due to start and to end” (10). The way in which the teachers and cousins helped More access Alibag can be understood under the rubric of people as infrastructure, described by AbdouMalique Simone on her essay “People as Infrastructure: Intersecting Fragments in Johannesburg” as a way to emphasize the “economic collaboration among residents seemingly marginalized from and immiserated by urban life.” More’s account can be understood as a story about people as infrastructure, the ways in which the collaborations he sustained negotiated marginalization by helping him receive an education. Alibag is an early example not only of how people as infrastructure allowed Moré access to resources to fund his schooling, but how people as infrastructure was a way to survive physically and emotionally through the hostility of caste prejudice: “During this journey of three days, I had the bitter experience that because we belonged to the Mahar caste people scorned us, treated us with contempt, insulted us and oppressed us, and my heart was distressed. Alibag was known throughout the Colaba district as a very orthodox and first-class misanthropic town. There even shadows were thought to be polluting. When we reached there we went to the home of a gentleman in the Mahar colony outside the town” (10). People as infrastructure is not just a matter of access to economic resources but it is a matter of surviving through the deterioration that comes about with caste discrimination. By sharing resources (addresses of people in other villages, anecdotal information about the routes, etc.), Moré becomes embedded in a web of social and economic relations between seemingly disparate locations, forming a spatial network of survival amid precarity.</p>

        <h3>First Visit to Bombay</h3>
        <center><image src="https://josdchavez.github.io/rbMore/images/dockyard_chipping.png"></center>
		<p>The spatial network that is formed through the social relations of people as infrastructure allows for a re-territorialization of the rural into the urban as seen by Moré during his first visit to Bombay, a re-territorialization that is both beneficial for him and other Mahars as they connect recently arrived migrants to already existing communities that resemble those from home but also detrimental in the sense that this re-territorialization is a form of spatial segregation that caste relations transformed into during early 20th century Bombay. It is a condition of possibility for people as infrastructure to distribute resources while also a way for caste relations to be maintained in the absence of a traditional untouchability practice. Moré remarks on first arriving to the city after taking his examination in Alibag: “This area of chawls was known as Family Lines. A large number of military pensioners and other Mahar people lived in these Family Lines. We went to stay with our relatives who lived there” (11).  Thus, people as infrastructure connect these different spaces that More transverses not only for the sake of food and shelter but also for the need to combat the prejudice of untouchability that is constantly posing a challenge to Moré’s goal of educating himself, as seen by the refusal of the Mahad school to enroll him even after he obtained a scholarship: “I was told that they were willing to take me into the school, but Dharap, who was the owner of the school building had told them, ‘If you admit a Mahar boy into the school I will not rent my building to you’” (13).</p>

        <h3>Return to Ladawali and Going to School in Mahad </h3>
        <image src="">
		<p>The refusal of enrollment is the moment when Moré, age 11, begins his career as a public activist, in a way. While in Ladawali after returning from Mahad, playwright Yashwant Narayan Tipnis and either Govind Gopal Tipnis or Anant Vinayak Chitré (all of whom were involved in anti-caste protest thought) help him write and publish a letter denouncing the school on the basis of caste discrimination: “They said that since I had won a government scholarship, the school at Mahaad would have to admit me. After that they dictated some things for me to write down on a piece of paper. I wrote it down and when I went home I copied it on to a postcard and sent the card to an address that they had given me” (14). The letter is effective since he “was called to the school and the matter I had written on the postcard had been published in a newspaper under my name” (14). The two people who helped More, who happened to be family friends, are thus necessary; the infrastructure they produce is crucial for a successful negotiation with untouchability.</p>
		<p>Moré’s sojourn in Mahad incites a more organized political consciousness that is first crystalized through the tea shop he helps open up for Mahars to have drinking water while traveling through: “All except the Mahaars could quench their thirst by asking the shopkeepers for water or going to the Mahaad lake. But the Mahaar people were reduced to a pitiable state in this regard. My heart became heavily burdened when I saw the cruel derision I have described above, to which they were subjected by well-to-do passers-by, and their problems in getting water to drink” (16). Addressing this cruel derision is the first time in the memoir where we see Moré actively becoming part of the people of infrastructure in order to build a tea shop: “I called a meeting in the Mahaar wada in Mahaad one day. Mahaar people from various villages in the Mahaad precinct were present at the meeting. After discussion it was decided that a tea shop would be set up in a field near the wagon yard. A condition was to be imposed that the person running the teashop would have to provide drinking water free of charge to our people…My going to the Mahaad school was, at least in Mahaad, a victory for the movement against untouchability” (17-18). The quote shows not only how More is also starting to use social relations to combat untouchability more explicitly and to alter space, but by saying that his going to school was a victory for the movement against untouchability he is further linking his life to caste critique, sustaining the rhetorical intertwinement which he uses to start narrating his life.</p>
		<p>If More’s memoir can be read as an account of people as infrastructure, it allows itself to be read for that infrastructure’s disposition. On “Extrastatecraft: The Power of Infrastructure Space,” Keller Easterling describes disposition as the place where the contradiction lies, between what the infrastructure says it’s doing and what it is actually doing. What does it mean to read for the disposition of people as infrastructure in Moré’s account? It means to uncover “accidental, covert, or stubborn forms of power” hiding behind it. Easterling’s emphasis on the stubborn forms of power behind infrastructure space is useful in relation to the issue of urbanization as it allows us to tease out the specificities of the non-place that generates the chronology of the memoir. Disposition allows us to think about the contradictions present in the text in order to flesh out the operations of power. Because it is power that disposition seeks to render visible, I argue that it is in the moments of primitive accumulation in the text, moments where More’s actions, relations and resources become appropriated by what we can retroactively call a logic of urbanization, that one can see how power constitutes lived, conceived and perceived space at the level of the everyday. This is most clearly seen through Moré’s mother and the constant hardship she’s depicted as experiencing at the hands of the father’s cousins with whom they were living after the death of his father: “Every month or two she would take me on a trip to Dasgaon and check what still remained and what had gone from our belongings. Whenever she discovered that rafters from the roof or materials for construction and carpentry work had disappeared, she would blame the people from the big house. They would treat me with affection and quarrel with my mother. Nobody paid heed to her protests and exhortation” (13). The affection they showed Moré was also a way to secure the money from his scholarship to them, “My mother was not happy about [him spending all his time between Dasgaon and Mahad]. But the people from the big house in Dasgaon would call me there with a show of affection and I, out of diffidence, would not go against their word. Later, when I began to get my five rupee per month scholarship, that money would go to them” (19). The moment of corruption (the paternal family taking the money from More and from his mother) is a moment of primitive accumulation, funding the lifestyle of the big house family which were described earlier by More as being the center of social life in Dasgaon. Through these quasi-side comments, Moré offers a glimpse on how the further entrenching that is taking place through urbanization happens along other axes of power such as gender. Whereas he can easily take advantage of people as infrastructure, the activities he exerts through it are still able to dispossess along intersecting lines of class-caste-gender that make the dispossession most intensely and continuously felt by his mother.</p>

        <h3>More's Mother and Wife: Back in Dasgaon and Charai</h3>
        <center><image src=""></center>
        <p>While his mother is the one who is constantly depicted as suffering the effects of the big family’s stealing of Moré’s money, he is also implicitly affected when the scholarship money runs out a year before it was supposed to because of the lull he was forced into when the school refused his enrollment during which the people in the big house (his paternal family) took it. More is forced to stay in Dasgaon which is were we can glimpse how is it that he is used as people as infrastructure (since he has access to resources like a scholarship) by the big family who abuses his affective ties with them to earn an income for themselves at the expense of the mother whose only source of income was “to collect firewood, chop it into small pieces, then tie it up with plant fibres and bring it home, and finally make small bundles to sell in that village or the next” (20). The fact that it is his mother who experiences the everyday precarity exacerbated by the big house’s corruption even when Moré himself is not really affected until later when he can no longer pay for school demonstrates that his actions, even when trying to combat untouchability, can easily be re-appropriated by the interlocking systems of oppression that inflict themselselves along a different axis of power, a.k.a gender, allowing Moré to have a perceived improvement in combating untouchability at least in his own experience. Gender as a determinant for the intensity of dispossession is also seen through the paternal’s family decision to marry More to his cousin in the advent of him moving to Bombay for work now that he cannot continue his education. The family marries him as a way to secure remittances to themselves, the job as a replacement for the scholarship money: “Neither I nor my mother were enthused to hear that my marriage had been arranged. My mind was distressed because I had had to leave school for lack of money, and my mother was always tense because of her widowhood and the trials she had to suffer” (21). Even after More becomes agreeable to the marriage, his wife can be understood as another victim of the violence that takes place along the lines of gender in the deployment of people as infrastructure since a) she completely disappears from the narrative after the brief mention of their marriage and travels to see her family in Charai and b) she is merely functioning as a way to make sure Moré will keep sending money back to Dasgaon. In considering the way dispossession operates along the lines of gender, we can see how the disposition of people as infrastructure (what it does as opposed to what it claims to be doing, i.e. combating untouchability) is a continuation of marginalization through the spatial relations of gender.</p>
	<p>In Charai, Moré does not recount much about his bride’s family but instead focuses on his relationship with a thief, an episode that allows us to start thinking who exactly are the people in the people of infrastructure we are talking about, people who are also marginalized, not necessarily along lines of caste but other social prejudices. His wife’s father, a rich landowner called Putalya Mahaar Patil, admired a thief in the Tale region called Chandrya Kaatkari: “He was much talked about. Rich people and government officials lived in fear of him. If anyone tormented the poor too much, he would teach them a lesson. He had a kind of hold over the khot moneylenders. The police could never lay their hands on him” (23). When Moré mentions he wanted to go to Tale to see the jatra, his father-in-law enlists Chandrya to take him: “It was two or three days later that I learnt from Dada that the person who had carried me on his shoulders through the forest was a well-known robber of those parts. It was only when I became acquainted with Marxism as an adult that I understood why brave and decent people like Chandrya become robbers” (23). Like Moré, Chandra is a marginalized subject who steals not to create urbanized land like the moneylenders in Dasgaon but if “anyone tormented the poor too much, he would teach them a lesson” (23).  From the thief’s behavior one can see that the affiliation between the people as infrastructure comes from a shared sense of marginalization from the larger social order. Given that Moré mentions how he only understood his behavior after being exposed to Marxism, it shows that this moment of solidarity is not happening through a lens of anti-caste thought but rather through class.</p>

    	<h3>SECTION 7 - BOMBAY AGAIN </h3>
        <center><image src=""></center>
	<p>QUOTES: Just as I recovered from this injury I was sent to Bombay for employment. This was my second trip to Bombay (24)  After coming to Bombay I had been staying with a distant relative in a chawl  in Family Lines.  We used to call his mother Aka.  I and three or four others from Daasgaon were staying at Aka’s place. They were all working somewhere or other and used to pay Aka for their food. It was four or five months since I had arrived and I had still not found a job. So I was not able to pay for my food. Nobody rebuked me, rather I was showered with affection. During this visit to Bombay I saw Dr. Ambedkar for the first time. Seeing Dr. Ambedkar made me acutely aware of the importance of getting an education. I had to leave school halfway because there was no one to support me (25) Most of the people living there earned their living doing some work connected with the army. (25) . Just then someone told me about a job; it was for just a month and a half, a leave vacancy, but the wages were forty-five rupees. But one needed to speak in English, to be able to read and write, and also to have good clothes. The person who had told me about the job had promised the sahib in that job that he would bring a man who would meet these terms.  One had to join service on the first. There were seven or eight days between. The main question was of the clothes; I had a dhoti and a coat. But this would not do among the European people; here one needed to have a coat and trousers. Finally I managed with the help of a butler. One the assigned day I was taken and stood before the sahib.  The sahib took me to an office and showed me some books of printed tickets that looked like receipts. He explained to me where to write the date and signature, and made me sit down near a table with a drawer for the receipt-books and money. On the outer side of the table there was a window. The white sailors would stand outside the window, pay their money and take the tickets. All the persons receiving the tickets were white and they did not know Hindi or Marathi; likewise my English was not good, but still our work was not held up. When they came up to the window and said, ‘one bed ticket’ or ‘four bar tickets’, I would take the money and give them what they asked for and the job was done.  To sum up, without much education and without any guarantee for the money, I got work as a seamen’s cashier. (25-6) . This extra money is not earned through toil, it is unholy money, it is a sin to keep it with you.  So you must spend it. All these friends smoked beedis, ate paan with tobacco, drank spirits and toddy and smoked pot and grass. They were the same ones who played one-string instruments, tambourines and drums and sang bhajans in the night. When we had finished eating something in the restaurant we would go and sit in a toddy bar in the Dhobi Talav or Crawford Market area. (26) She thought it a great thing that I brought my whole salary to her. I told her to take twenty rupees of it for my meals, five rupees to spend on herself, and to send the remaining twenty rupees to my home in Dasgaon.  She sent on the twenty rupees, but the people in the big house in Dasgaon did not give the money to my mother (27) I began to go to the docks to look for work. If one didn’t find work, one could go near the ships and try and find something to eat. One could get dates, all kinds of dried fruits, sugar to eat on the ships. One could also get a full meal for two pice. Sometimes one could get work as a labourer on daily wages. If one stood in the queue for work, even if one wasn’t selected as a labourer, one got one anna for attending the muster-call. It was to the Alexandra Docks that I went most often (28) By standing in line, doing the work of  ‘stamping’ when I got it, or doing coolie work for daily wages at the railway station, I could cover my expenses and pay for my board. Later I got work as a ‘marker’  in the Arsenal depot at Haji Bandar (dock). I had obtained this job for a salary of thirty rupees a month after months of being unemployed. (28) But when I started going to work at Haji Bandar I became familiar with some new areas of Bombay. The main among these were Grant Road and Foras Road. Later on I began to go to these areas Moré  and Moré  often. This was because three of my new-found companions were taking part in the Kamleshwar Drama Company that had just been started. (28) The Batatyachi Chawl where our theatre room was located was in the Safed Galli (literally, white lane). This Safed Galli was a big centre of the prostitution business. All the chawls in that area were buzzing with prostitutes. Prostitutes lived in some of the rooms in Batatyachi Chawl and tamasha players and other people lived  in the remaining rooms. (29) my friends kept a distance from bad things. This was because they were educated and cultured. Their attraction to the art of the theatre can be said to be a sign of their being cultured.  This was their way of trying to rise from a lower class to a higher class. After the rehearsals of the play Manovijay, it was first staged in the Bombay Theatre. I was of course proud to have worked as an actor on the stage of such a famous theatre in Bombay at such a young age (30) The money that I sent home when I was working in the Sailors’Home never reached my mother. This was repeated when I worked at Haji Bandar.  I always felt that the environment in Bombay was not conducive to study, that I would be able to go on studying if I went to Puné. My mothers’ relatives found it very strange that the people from the big house pocketed my money instead of giving it to my mother. But others would say, the people at the big house educated the boy, so why should they not take the money? (30) There was about twenty rupees in my pocket. It was about midnight.  I went to Bori Bandar station and got on the train to Puné without buying a ticket, and got down in Puné before sunrise (31)</p>

        <h3>SECTION 8 - FROM PUNE TO ALEGAONKAR HS</h3>
	<center><image src=""></center>
        <p>QUOTES: Since Modi Khana was a colony of army pensioners and since the name Abitkar was well known there, I had no difficulty in finding their house. The woman’s name was Kaali (Blackie). She was of fair complexion, pleasant and naive. But since her name was Kaali we used to call her Kaalibai. (31) I was afraid that, if I told them I had come to Puné to study, these people would inform Dasgaon and my schoolteacher relatives would come and take me back to Bombay. So I didn’t tell them anything about that. I had decided in my mind to stay with them as a guest for a few days, and then slip away from there. So while I was staying with them I tried to get to know Moré  about Puné. But they did not know anything beyond army –related places;  their knowledge was limited to the cantonment area of Puné.  They told me some stories they had heard about the days of Peshwa rule. They said, “We have nothing to do with Poona city. We hardly ever go there.” Even the children of the Modi Khana area did not go to school with children from the city. There were separate schools for these children in the vicinity. Just as in Bombay I had lived in the Family Lines meant for army people, so did I find myself among military people in Modi Khana.  In the villages there were separate areas for our folk. I felt that even in Bombay and Puné there were separate colonies for us, but I did not at the time understand who had separated us in this way. (32) The train left the station and halted for some time at Khadki station. (32) One day, a man in the canteen introduced me to a friend of his who worked in the Khadki arsenal.  He pointed out to me who the main boss in the arsenal was, and informed me about how I could get to meet him.  Accordingly I  came and stood at the gate of the arsenal at the time when the sahib was due to come there.  When the sahib approached I said, “Sir, I know English, I want work”. He said, “Come on.” I walked on behind him. When we entered the gate he entrusted me to a sergeant and went off. The sergeant began to show his disapproval by raising his eyebrows at me. Then he said something. But because of my limited English and his incomprehensible accent I didn’t understand what he said. Then he asked me my name. That much English I understood. I told him my name, which he wrote down, and then took me with him to a depot. There in a waterlogged place there were piles of wooden boxes filled with glassware.  About twenty convicts from the Yerawada jail were standing there. The sergeant told me to instruct the prisoners to carry those boxes to a dry place at some distance.  I made out what he was saying only from from his expression and gestures, and explained what he was saying to the prisoners’ warder in bazaar Hindi.  With that the work of moving the chests began. The sergeant was pleased to see this and he praised me. (33-4) I went to live in a chawl next to the Khadki bazaar. A gentleman from the Konkan who had retired from the khechar (mule) section of the army was living in a rented room there with his wife from Puné. They had no children and they knew nothing about their native gaon or village. I made their acquaintance and found out all I could learn about them. After I left the Modi Khana I took utmost care about one thing: to find out whatever I could about others, but never to reveal the true facts about myself. I behaved in this same manner with this couple. Then, seeing that I was educated, had a job and had nowhere to stay, they asked me to come and stay with them and I began to live in that chawl. After I got the job in the Arsenal I found a kind of stability. (34) The difference between a coolie and a clerk was only in the hardness of their labour. A clerk did not have to put in as much bodily exertion as a coolie did. In fact both the jobs needed no intellect!  The type of work I did went on changing quickly, but there was not much change in my life beyond work. The kind of environment which I inhabited since I left Kaalibai’s house in Modi Khana was one of joginis and muralis dedicated to the gods, the licentious behaviour of the white soldiers and their friends, and the pitiable condition of the poor who worked in occupations related to the army. I felt suffocated living in these surroundings. But one thing was clear: I was aware that I was living in a foul kind of environment. And so I was always making efforts to get out of it. When a man living on his own is aware of the sin he is committing, he feels remorse when he is punished and makes efforts to come away from it. But if he is not aware, he feels no remorse even after he suffers punishment, and makes no efforts to turn away from that deed. When I left the unhealthy environment of Dapodi  and went to live in Khadki, my life had turned in an appropriate direction. Soon after I came to Khadki, I had to have a small surgical operation on my right leg. My Indian soldier friends arranged for me to get admitted to the Khadki Military Hospital to get this done. The operation on my leg was done in that hospital and my ailment  was removed. I worked for two months after this operation. Then I learned about a night school that had been opened recently. This night school had been started by the Alegaonkar brothers who were followers of Lokmanya Tilak.  Its name was ‘Alegaonkars’ Night School’. As soon as I heard about this night school, I went there and registered my name.  Since I was in a job I had no difficulty in paying the fees and meeting the expense of buying books. My admission to night school was like a new life for me. It was a great joy for me that I had become a student again. (35-6) From the time I began to go to night school, I avoided spending too much time with my friends who were fond of tamashas, plays, cards, and gambling. Gradually I became detached from all these things. (36) In the Alegaonkars’ school my name had been entered for the fourth form. From there I entered the fifth form (38)  Just then news of an important event reached me: the death of Lokmanya Tilak.  To learn Moré  about this I went to Alegaonkars’ school with a few friends. There we were informed that a special train had been arranged for those who wanted to take part in Lokmanya Tilak’s funeral procession. (39)</p>

        <h3>SECTION 9 - BACK TO BOMBAY TO BACK TO MAHAD</h3>
	<center><image src=""></center>
        <p>QUOTES: Arriving in Bombay I was able to witness the unprecedented event of Tilak’s funeral procession. But I could still not put an end to the troubled and uncertain pattern of my life. Sardargruha, the place from which the procession set off, was just a small distance from the Family Lines where I had been staying before I left Bombay (39) After that, I walked as far as Bori Bandar and sat down in the Bhatia Gardens near there around one-thirty. In the gardens some people were sleeping, some were sitting on benches and some were walking around here and there. I decided to spend the night sitting there rather than waking my relatives at that time of night. (39) Since I was not new to Bombay I was still confident that I would find a way out of this.  So, without thinking too much about what had happened, I took the road to the docks. I went to an illiterate supervisor and agreed to write down  the names of the dockhands for him for any wages he was willing to give me. (40) But I had to be careful that I had enough money left over for breakfast in the morning. Sometimes I could not get work for as long as four days. At such times I would barely eat something with the help of my friends at work. My friends too were like me.  We helped each other as friends and accomplices. (40) Then I went to visit one of my relatives who lived in the Cement Chawl in Parel. He was happy to see me after such a long time. At night, after dinner I went to bed there. In the morning I had my first hot-water bath in days, had breakfast and then went upstairs to try and meet Ambedkar  Saheb (41)</p>

        <h3>SECTION 10 - BACK TO MAHAD</h3>
	<center><image src=""></center>
        <p>QUOTES: My mother felt as though I had been reborn (41) My homecoming this time became the subject of talk in every house, because it was well-known that persons from that village community from several generations who had vanished like me, never came back again. How was it that I had returned?  From this it appears that many persons of our community, not just from our villages but from other villages, often left their village and vanished. Could it be that this migration was an attempt at an individual escape from untouchability ? When I returned to Dasgaon I found that my home had become a school. Our house had been rented out to a Mahaar school and my mother was living in a small shed next to the big house and living on the wages of her labour. One of my father’s maternal cousins was the teacher in that school and he did not even give the rent to my mother. (42) Because I was caught in the deceitful net of false affection that the people at the big house cast over me, and I still did not have the courage to break out of it. I behaved just as those people asked me to behave. They, rather than my mother, exerted their authority over me. I had to hand over my salary to them. However, I did not give the rent money to them but to my mother. They made a noise about this at first, but I did not listen to them.  So I began to hand over three rupees a month as rent and two rupees for sweeping and cleaning the rooms daily, to my mother. Besides this, I spared whatever money I could out of my pay, for basic needs, to give my mother. In those days one could buy a mann measure of rice for a rupee and other things were also cheap. So my mother got some relief. Now, whether I went on working as a teacher or not, five rupees a month would come into my mother’s hands.  My return to Dasgaon secured this much for my mother. (42) I had not gone to Bombay and Puné with the intention of making money. My objective was education.  I felt bad because my education was incomplete. (42) . I was being offered the job even though I didn’t have the necessary educational qualifications.  That was because I had relatives in the Mahaar regiment, and this  Conservator had been connected to the Mahaar and other army regiments. So this was a rare opportunity for me.  But when the people in the big house and our neighbours sat down together at night to think about this offer, except for me and one or two other persons everyone was of the opinion that I should not take this job. What they said was that this was the Forest Office after all. Nobody could tell when I might be murdered there. Others will not like it (that I had such an important post). They will conspire to bring you down in any way they can and later will say they had nothing to do with it. Even though we are under British rule, our people are not taken into government service anywhere except in the army. Even an ordinary policeman’s job is not given to our people. Even guards in the Forest Office are usually not from among our people. In view of all this, I should not take this job.--- this was  everybody’s opinion.  Some said, “Even if it is a golden dagger, should one pierce it in one’s own heart?” On one side there was this resistance from my family, and on the other my fervent desire to study further, and so I let a good opportunity pass. If I had accepted this job offer, I would have been much talked about as the first untouchable in the Bombay Presidency to be a candidate for a post as high as a Ranger in  a civil service job in the government. (43-4)  When my term as a teacher in the leave vacancy was over, I changed from being a teacher to a student. My name was entered in the school at Mahaad once again  in the fifth English class. (44) . After I was admitted to the school in Mahaad for the first time, a tea-shop had been started in the marketplace to solve the problem I, and my brethren coming from the villages, faced in getting drinking water. That restaurant was still running when I returned. It used to be closed during the rains and open in the hot seasons; but because it was far from the untouchable colony nobody stayed there at night.  But now there were more customers visiting the teashop.  There had been a  very large inflow of ex-soldiers in that vicinity.  This was due to the disbanding   and breaking up of the 111th Mahaar regiment  after the war was over. These unemployed soldiers were now earning their subsistence through farming or through manual labour. Because of their military occupation and their having travelled widely, they were bold and courageous. (46) . That tea-shop had become a virtual information centre for  a circle of about sixty  square miles around Mahaad.  Raigad, Pratapgad and the villages of the valley come within that circle. (46) At one point a landlord named Deshmukh closed down that tea-shop owned by Mohoprekar, as part of an action taken against Mohoprekar, who was his tenant. But I defeated the landlord’s action: I took over the teashop myself,  put up a board saying “R.B. Moré’s Rest House”, and then got it going again (48) .  One day after the bill had been passed, I organised a small meeting  in the Mahaar colony with  some military pensioners visiting the marketplace and some of my friends, where I told them about this bill which had been passed by the government. Besides me, there was another outspoken person present, an elderly man  named Maruti Agavane. (49) In that meeting we made a decision of historical importance: to hold a conference of the Colaba District Outcaste Association in Mahaad under the chairmanship of Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar. The heads of caste panchayats were entrusted with the responsibility of collecting three rupees a head from each and every village, to cover the expenses of holding the conference. Now a new air of enthusiasm sprang up among the untouchable youth in the marketplace. Everywhere there was talk about the prospect of Ambedkar Saheb coming to Mahaad for a big gathering. (49)</p>

        <h3>SECTION 11 - DASMODAR HALL / CONFERENCE</h3>
	<center><image src=""></center>
        <p>QUOTES: Later, in 1924, in the month of May, I went to Bombay and met Ambedkar Saheb.  The people of the Social Service League had given him a room on the first floor above the Damodar restaurant in Parel (50) He (Ambedkar) inquired about where I lived, what I did, how far I had studied and so on, and expressed his satisfaction. He then said to me, “You don’t know what people of the Konkan are like. They are very obstinate. They will always say, what we do is as it should be. They will say, who is this Christ-lover coming here telling us what to do? And they won’t listen to me.”  To  which I answered, “Saheb, they listen to me so they will certainly listen to you.” In the end he said, “I have no time just now. Come back during the Diwali vacations and we will see what we can do.” Then I went back to Chitré who was in the next room. He asked me how I intended to collect money for the conference, and I told him that the people from villages all over would raise a little money. He then promised to help us in the financing and so we chalked out a plan.  The plan was to put up a play and use the income from that for the conference (50) We had secured a free performance of this play solely on the word of Chitré and Kadam. But who was to carry out the responsibility of selling the tickets? The play was to be performed in the Damodar Hall, and this hall was owned by the Social Service League. So we were to get the hall also for free. We only had to arrange for the sale of tickets. I felt that Balaram Ambedkar (Bhimrao’s elder brother) could help us out in this, and so I went to see him and asked for his help. He too was very happy to learn that a conference was to be held in Mahaad. He promised that he would come to Mahaad for the conference, but he did not undertake the responsibility of selling tickets. (51) . When he heard that I had received my Marathi and English education in the villages and when he heard about our plans for the conference, he was overcome with emotion.  But when it came to the question of selling tickets, he flatly refused to sell the tickets himself or to get someone else to sell them, pointing to the people’s bad habits and addictions.  Balaram Ambedkar and Sambhaji Gaikwad were at the time the only two people I knew in the whole of Bombay who had a concern for social activity, excepting Dr. Ambedkar himself. Since both of them had turned me down, I was very disappointed. Then I went to meet three friends of mine who lived in the servants’ quarters of St. George Hospital in the Fort area. I told them about all this business of selling tickets for the  play. All three of them were working as uniformed guards or peons. Two of them were barely literate and the third had passed the fourth standard examination in  Marathi school. With the help of these friends I managed to sell some four-anna tickets  and about twenty eight-anna and ten-anna tickets. And on the actual day of the performance these three came with me to the Damodar Hall to see to the other arrangements. I seated the one who was most educated at the ticket window to sell tickets, and gave the job of checking the tickets of people entering the theatre to the other two. Since the hall had four or five entrances, these two were not able to do their job properly. (51) After a while the curtain was raised and I stood up. There was a clamour of applause. I placed my hands on the table to steady myself and gave thanks in a few words speaking slowly, as if I was giving dictation to a class of schoolchildren.  This was the first speech I had made before an audience of the educated of Bombay, on the dais of a public hall. (51)</p>
