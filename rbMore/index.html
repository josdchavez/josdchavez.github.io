        <p>QUOTES: "The first capital of the Marathi state in modern times was Raaigad. It was in the village of Laadawali in the precinct of this same Raaigad that I was born, at dawn on a Sunday on the second day of the lunar month, in the year 1903 C.E. The night of the Chhabina of Viroba at Mahaad was drawing to an end." (1) "Along with them, brandishing their long poles of bamboo with red, green, yellow and white streamers tied to them, walk thousands of sturdy people of all castes, shouting out chants of Harahar Mahaadev, forgetting all caste distinctions and untouchability." "Only in the homes of Mahaars, not those of people of any other caste. Because these gods, especially Bhairi and Kalkai, are originally the Mahaars’ gods, and after that they are the gods of all the villagers" The reason I have talked about the Chhabina of Viroba and the different gods taking part in the jatra when I told of the time of my birth, is to make it clear that people do not distinguish between touchable and untouchable on these occasions." (2) " And it is the social reformers, political leaders and so-called thinkers who, even though they understood the importance of the problem of untouchability, followed those persons from the upper castes, and beat the drum of the national independence struggle for years on end, with the result that untouchability did not end and the oppressed, exploited majority of the Indian people never attained real national independence. When we say today that our nation is independent, it means that it is no longer under the rule of foreign British rulers, but now it is dominated by our own landlords and capitalists"</p>

        <p>Quotes: “My elder brother and sister were already married and they had died. And all the land, estate, and wealth that he had accumulated through his own efforts had been lost in the court cases filed against him by the Muslim Khot moneylenders from around Dasgaon (3) “At this time he became a poor farmer who had enough land to provide for himself. By working his own land, he could meet the needs of his family. This went on till I was eight or nine years old, and then, becoming the victim of a moneylender’s treachery, he lost all his own land. This is how it happened: the moneylender sweet-talked him into signing a blank piece of paper, and then he wrote on it that my father had sold his land. Of course the moneylender became owner of that land, and my father, the former owner, became a mere tenant. Inevitably then, it was up to the landowner’s whim whether he would allow my father to go on working the land as a tenant, and in the end the expected happened.  One day the moneylender evicted my father from that land for good, and he was obliged to live the painful  life of a landless labourer. This happened when  my father’s death was two or three years away. One cannot imagine what a devastating jolt this was for him.” (3-4) “When I was five or six years old I began to attend the Marathi school in Dasgaon. At the time, in the entire Konkan region, there was no village Marathi school for Dalits other than the school in Dasgaon.” (4) “The few untouchable folk in the Konkan who managed to get an education in those days did it through being in the military. The children of military pensioners went to schools in cities like Puné, Bombay and Satara. The only village school giving an education to untouchable children was and is in Dasgaon: nowhere else” (4) “The reason for Dasgaon and the Dasgaon school gaining such importance is that it was  a port for small boats, surrounded by mountains with crags and cliffs, covered with terrifying  dense forests inhabited by all kinds of wild animals including tigers.” (4) “Dasgaon had become a point of transit joining Dapoli military camp with Bombay. Dasgaon also became a place of retirement for military pensioners staying at Dapoli. With Dasgaon already having the strength of local unity, and with the support of high-ranked military officers who were also their brethren, nobody would dare to cross them, or have the nerve to take away the rights that they had attained.” (5)</p>

        <p>QUOTES: "When I was ill he visited our house once or twice, and sat down on the cot where I was sleeping to inquire after me affectionately. In 1914 he sent me to Alibag to appear for the high school scholarship examination for under-elevens that was held at the district centre. I passed in the first rank among Moré  than two hundred students who appeared for the exam, and was awarded a government scholarship of five rupees a month" (8) "When we reached Talé my uncle bought me a new outfit for going to Alibag and sent me back to Dasgaon. When I came to Dasgaon my father had fallen ill and was confined to his bed." (9) "At a time  when my father was at death’s door and my mother  had just risen from childbed, there was not a morsel of food in our house.  Why was a man who had  a field with six ploughs, who had arranged the marriages of about twenty people from the Kunbi, Bhoi, and Mulsim communities with his own money, reduced to such a condition at the moment of death? The real cause of this tragic situation was my father’s extreme unselfishness and the usurious noose of the British imperialists."(9) "My uncle took my mother and sister to Ladawali and Namdeo dada set out for Alibag with me. We took with us enough bhakari and chatni to last us for three days. Namdeo dada was another maternal cousin of my father’s and he too was a schoolmaster. He knew everything we needed to know about the jouney: how long it would take to reach Alibag and by which route, and also when the examination was due to start and to end. In those days we had to complete the whole journey on foot. We started out from Dasgaon in the morning and made a night stop at Indapur." (10) "During this journey of three days, I had the bitter experience that because we belonged to the Mahar caste people scorned us, treated us with contempt, insulted us and oppressed us, and my heart was distressed.	Alibag was known throughout the Colaba district as a very orthodox and first-class misanthropic town. There even shadows were thought to be polluting. When we reached there we went to  the home of a gentleman in the Mahar colony outside the town" (10) The question paper was tossed to me from a distance and when I had finished writing my paper, I pushed it forward. It was picked up from there and taken away. All this was carried out with the utmost care to avoid touching me at any point." (11)</p>

		<p>QUOTES: "In Bombay, a squat set of chawls had been built along the road leading to Carnac Bridge, between Musafirkhana and Crawford Market. This area of chawls was known as Family Lines.  A large number of military pensioners and other Mahar people lived in these Family Lines. We went to stay with our relatives who lived there."(11)"In our house at Dagsaon there were still pots and pans and and other baggage belonging to us,  and my mother kept her eye on them. Every month or two she would take me on a trip to Dasgaon and check what still remained and what had gone from our belongings. Whenever she discovered that rafters from the roof or materials for construction and carpentry work had disappeared, she would blame the people from the big house. They would treat me with affection and quarrel with my mother. Nobody paid heed to her protests and exhortations. While we were living in Ladawali,  I once got a summons from Dasgaon. I went there and found that the school had informed us that I had passed with first rank in the examination at Alibag. The government had awarded me a scholarship of five rupees a month to attend the English school. Hearing this, the people from the big house made much of me. They seemed even fonder of me than before.  I was also extremely happy to learn that from June I would be going to the English school in Mahaad. I became impatient for the two months in between to pass so that I could  go to the English school. The English school at Mahaad had been established before I was born and was in a one-story building opposite the post and telegraph office. This building belonged to a well-known Brahman family with the name of Dharap and had been  leased out to the school. When the school opened in June I went and met the schoolmaster and asked him to put my name on the rolls. He took down my details and asked me to return after a week. When I went back after a week I was told that they were willing to take me into the school, but Dharap, who was the owner of the school building had told them, “If you admit a Mahar boy into the school I will not rent my building to you.” (12-3) </p>

		<p>QUOTES: I would lose myself completely in this singing and dancing. I was able to tell stories and also to read from the holy books. So the people of Ladawali would make much of me.  All the people from my  mama’s (maternal uncle’s) colony would invite me to eat in their homes. I had uncles, grandmothers,  aunts in every house. I did not know how the rainy season passed in that atmosphere of love and affection. (13) They asked me several questions to get information about me.  I answered their questions. They said that since I had won a government scholarship, the school at Mahaad would have to admit me. After that they dictated some things for me to write down on a piece of paper. I wrote it down and when I went home I copied it on to  a postcard and sent the card to an address that they had given me. Within a month I received a message from the school; I was called to the school and the matter I had written on the postcard had been published in a newspaper under my name. This was shown to me and I was asked, “Did you write this?” I said yes. There was a great commotion among the teachers and pupils of the school. One said, “ Such a small boy and what nerve he has. He asks for the school’s grant to be stopped!” From another came the remark,   “This is why we have to keep these people at a distance”. Some teachers and boys were glaring at me. After all this, the headmaster told me to come to school from Monday. – “We have decided to take your name on the rolls of this school.” I returned to Dasgaon and recounted what had happened. The teachers in Dasgaon, and others, were very happy to hear it and congratulated me. I came to Ladawali, thanked Bhikoba and asked who his two guests were. He said, they are my brothers. When  it was learned that t one of them was a famous playwright of Maharashtra, Yashwant Narayan Tipnis. I could not find out exactly about the other. He was probably Govind Gopal Tipnis or Anant Vinayak Chitré.  (14-15) Before I was admitted to the Mahaad school I had been living in Ladawali, and after this too I stayed on at Ladawali and went daily to the school which was a mile or two away. In the Mahar community widespread tales were told about the perfidious machinations of Brahmans and other upper castes, and so the whole community had become suspicious.  When I started going to school in Mahaad my mother gave me strict warnings.  She would say,  “Don’t eat anything that anyone gives you, don’t drink their water”, and even, “Don’t eat so much as a paan, they might put anything inside it and take your life.” Our classes started at ten or eleven in the morning and went on till five in the evening. From the time I had a meal at  home and left for school in the morning till I returned home, I would not touch a morsel of food. (16) The real problem arose for the poor people who came to the marketplace from far off. Among them all except the Mahaars could quench their thirst by asking the shopkeepers for water or going to the Mahaad lake. But the Mahaar people were reduced to a pitiable state in this regard. My heart became heavily burdened when I saw the cruel derision I have described above, to which they were subjected by well-to-do passers-by, and their problems in getting water to drink. The  people from the Raaigad valley who came to Mahaad, parched with thirst, would get water only when they came to the river at Laadawali or Kinjoli.  (16)
And from this came the idea of starting a teashop in the place where carts were parked, to solve the problem of drinking water. It was to explain this idea to a few important people that I called a meeting in the Mahaar wada  in Mahaad one day. Mahaar people from various villages in the Mahaad precinct were present at the meeting. After discussion it was decided that a tea shop would be set up in a field near the wagon yard. A condition was to be imposed that the person running the teashop would have to provide drinking water free of charge to our people. (17) My going to the Mahaad school was, at least in Mahaad, a victory for the movement against untouchability (18) This was an adda, a gathering-place, for us in the marketplace. In the beginning nobody would stay there at night. But after some time some persons would stay there even at night (18) . In reality, what was the need for me to go to Dashaon every Saturday when my mother and sister were at Laadawali? My mother was not happy about this. But the people from the big house in Dasgaon  would call me there with a show of affection and I, out of diffidence, would not go against their word. Later, when I began  to get my five rupee per month scholarship, that money would go to them (19) .  I was informed by the school that I would not get the scholarship money from then on. What happened to the three years’ scholarship?  The third year was probably counted as the time which was wasted before I was admitted to the school. While I was going to school the small expenditure that was required for my uniform, books and so on, was taken from my scholarship money. But if I was not getting the scholarship the question arose as to who would undertake that expense. Our people in Dasgaon who had taken ascholar’s money were not willing to spend now, and my uncle was already hard pressed to support us on his meagre income. In this situation, my mother said, whatever happens we must go and live in our house in Dasgaon now (19) </p>

        <p>QUOTES: "She did all the work in the house, but she had not worked outside in the fields. But now after we returned to Dasgaon she started to go outto collect firewood, chop it into small pieces, then tie it up with plant fibres and bring it home, and finally make small  bundles to sell in that village or the next village, and bring back   food or money in exchange.  This was the subsistence occupation of many poor persons in Dasgaon.  The forest of Dasgaon was the only means of livelihood and sustenance for them. I too used to go with other children to collect twigs. Once when we had gone to the forest like this, a forest guard tried to catch three boys of my age and a young man, confiscate their sickles and take them to the police chowkie" (20) When I had left school and was living in Dasgaon collecting firewood and doing odd jobs for the big house, a guest from Bombay came to the big house. He asked me how far I had studied, what I was doing, and so on and after this he told my four Dadas--- my father’s maternal cousins --- that if they sent Ramchandra (me) to Bombay he would secure for me a job as ticket collector with a monthly salary of forty-five rupees. At the time all these brothers were teachers in the Mahar school and they were earning eleven rupees a month. They reckoned: the four of us together earn four times eleven or forty-four rupees, and Ramchandra on his own is going to get a rupee Moré  than that! ---`so they decided that they would send Ramchandra to Bombay to become a collector (20) Neither I nor my mother were enthused to hear that my marriage had been arranged.  My mind was distressed because I had had to leave school for lack of money, and my mother was always tense because of her widowhood and the trials she had to suffer. My marriage was taking place in this situation. What could we say other than---“Fine, let it happen” --? If the people from the big house taunted her on the subject of  my marriage, she would say,  my boy is not yet old enough to be married. If you don’t want to arrange his marriage don’t do it, but don’t bother me with claims of your generosity. Of course, this business of her son, with no one to look after him, getting married, was in fact something that made her glad; and as for me, why should I not like the idea of getting married? To sum up, both my mother and I were agreeable to the marriage. We were happy that this marriage was taking place. The person whose daughter I was going to marry had great affection for my father. My father had tried hard to rescue him from the ill-treatment he was subjected to by his stepmother. And so he always remained grateful to my father (21) This plan was as follows: adjoining the classroom where the third standard had classes, was a window about two and a half to three feet high. A platform was to be erected outside  this window. I was to ascend this platform with the help of a small ladder, so that I could face the class and be in communication with the teacher and my classmates, and could learn my lessons without touching other children in my class or in the school.  Dada, my father-in-law, agreed to this plan and four workmen were hired at once to build the platform. They cut down branches from a nanduki tree in the school compound and under Dada’s guidance built the platform in two days.  After this, Dada took me to see the school, my classroom and the place where I was to sit.  When I saw the whole setup I told Dada that I was not prepared to learn my lessons sitting on a stage outside the school building.  --- “In the Mahaad school they used to seat me separately outside the classroom, but at least the place was inside the school building. Here they are making me sit on a stage on the barren land behind the building , I don’t like it at all.” (22) , I was taken to Charai, a village near Talé, as a guest. My wife’s grandfather lived there. His name was Putalaji and he owned land which had a yield of almost a thousand rupees. At that time he was the Police patil of the village. Even in the rainy season there were twenty  to forty sheaves of rice remaining in his granary. Four or five big pots of milk would come to the house every day. He was that rich. His sons and daughters had come to Dasgaon for the wedding buthedid not himself attend. We were taken to Charai to see him. He and his wife welcomed us and made much of us. (22) He was much talked about. Rich people and government officials lived in fear of him. If anyone tormented the poor too much, he would teach them a lesson. He had a kind of hold over the khot moneylenders. The police could never lay their hands on him (23) . It was two or three days later that I learnt from Dada that the person who had carried me on his shoulders through the forest was a well-known robber of those parts. It was only when I became acquainted with Marxism as an adult that I understood why brave and decent people like Chandrya become robbers. (23) </p>
