        <h3>Ladawali: More's birth and the Chabina of Viroba</h3>
        <center><image src="https://josdchavez.github.io/rbMore/images/moreposter_mahad.JPG"></center>
        <p>R.B Moré begins the narrative of his life in Ladawali during the celebration of the Chabina of Viroba, consciously intertwining geographic space and his birth with anti-caste discussion. He describes how untouchability was not practiced during this religious procession that prominently featured Mahars. The intertwinement suggests that Moré wants us to read his text as a critique of untouchability that details how he negotiated marginalization, vis-a-vis caste-class prejudice, in order to achieve a certain level of “improvement.” The alignment of his life with a critique of untouchability happens in his opening sentence: “The first capital of the Marathi state in modern times was Raaigad. It was in the village of Laadawali in the precinct of this same Raaigad that I was born, at dawn on a Sunday on the second day of the lunar month, in the year 1903 C.E. The night of the Chhabina of Viroba at Mahaad was drawing to an end” (1). The quote performs a number of symbolic associations between Moré and Ladawali that establish his authority: by saying he was born on “this same Raaigad” that was the first capital of the Marathi state, he establishes himself as an inheritor and continuator of the political centrality of Raaigad to Maharashtra in relation to Dalit activism, receiving and expanding the rich tradition of anti-caste thought in the region. Furthermore, with “The night of the Chhabina of Viroba at Mahaad was drawing to an end,” he is also associating himself with a ritual where untouchability is not salient, a trait he wants his life to be defined by, “The reason I have talked about the Chhabina of Viroba and the different gods taking part in the jatra when I told of the time of my birth, is to make it clear that people do not distinguish between touchable and untouchable on these occasions” (2).  This sentence comes before Moré’s discussion on how his father’s poverty came about, setting the tone of fervent critique that imbues the rest of the memoir.</p>
	<p> The decision to start his memoir with the Chabina of Viroba, however, offers us the possibility of looking at the absence of untouchability during the procession from a perspective that is not only because of religious practice but also because of spatial organization. If the procession is anything like it is practiced today (see the “Ladawali: Chabina of Viroba” marker on the map), one can see that the density of people that attend and the need to walk through a space that can only hold a limited amount of bodies would have made it quite difficult for untouchability to be maintained. Just how in Bombay during this time period rural, Dalit migrants escaped untouchability due to the constraints of the infrastructures of transportation and communication that forced bodies to be in close proximity of each other, the lack of untouchability in the procession might also relate to space itself. My intention behind this suggestion is not to discredit Moré; it is to introduce the manner in which this mapping project will be reading the text in order to see beyond the author's conscious weaving of the text. Looking at spatial organization allows us to ask: How is the logic of urbanization that Moré is a part of (given his constant migration across villages and the city of Bombay) allowing him to combat precarity while simultaneously appropriating his actions and entrenching the conditions of marginalization the memoir is so explicitly against? How can a visualization of More’s memoir as a proxy for the dynamics of rural-urban migration help us see not only the dispossession of people from rural land but how their actions become appropriated for the reproduction of marginalization and its implied socioeconomic relations? </p>

        <h3>Dasgaon and Dapoli: The Army as a Space of Economic Achievement</h3>
        <center><image src="https://josdchavez.github.io/rbMore/images/mahar_army.jpg"></center>
        <p>Some might argue against my decision to prominently feature the issue of urbanization in relation to this memoir given that it might appear anachronistic to the text and an issue that I’m imposing on it. However, if urbanization is understood how Neil Brenner defines it in “Theses of Urbanization” as a process of "creatively destructive patterning of modern sociospatial landscapes" that is predicated upon the dispossession of people from rural land, one recognizes the memoir’s potential to offer a view of how this creative destructive pattern takes place at the level of the everyday. Moré explains that the conditions of poverty that forced him and his family to move happened when moneylenders from Dasgaon tricked his father into giving them their land: “The moneylender sweet-talked him into signing a blank piece of paper, and then he wrote on it that my father had sold his land. Of course the moneylender became owner of that land, and my father, the former owner, became a mere tenant. Inevitably then, it was up to the landowner’s whim whether he would allow my father to go on working the land as a tenant, and in the end the expected happened. One day the moneylender evicted my father from that land for good, and he was obliged to live the painful life of a landless labourer. This happened when my father’s death was two or three years away” (3). The moneylenders stole from the Moré family to turn the land into “private property” that a proper subject, i.e. a subject willing to pay, could own. More's previous symbolic association between himself, land and anti-caste thought allows the reader to easily associate this episode, symbolically, with primitive accumulation. Moré’s explanation on the importance of Dasgaon and Dapoli for Mahars also shows how primitive accumulation might have allowed Mahars in the region to reach high levels of economic achievement. Dapoli was inhabited mostly by powerful Mahars who had obtain their wealth and social capital after serving in the army, it is very close to Dasgaon, which is were many Mahars would move after living in Dapoli: “With Dasgaon already having the strength of local unity, and with the support of high-ranked military officers who were also their brethren, nobody would dare to cross them, or have the nerve to take away the rights that they had attained. The (Mahar) people of Dasgaon broke the restrictions of religion and tradition to build large houses and wear fine clothes and ornaments. They obtained school education and acquired high government posts” (5). The army was a way through which Mahars from the area could improve their economic situation, it can even be seen as a symbiotic relationship from the postcard embedded on the Dapoli marker. Thus Dasgaon represents a contradiction within the (spatial) text: it is both an origin point for More’s poverty but also for Mahar economic realization.  He even goes to school in Dasgaon because no other school in the region will accept Mahars due to the taboo of untouchability. The urbanization of Dasgaon is what took the Moré family land but it is also what allowed material conditions of (relative) prosperity. It can thus be understood as that non-place that allows More’s narrative to have a beginning, to have a chronology to his caste critique that gains recognition as history.Bhabha explains the importance of the non-place via de Certeau: “In order to appear as material or empirical reality, the historical or social process must pass through an aesthetic alienation or privatization of its public visibility. The discourse of the social then finds its means of representation in a kind of unconsciousness” (143). This “unconsciousness” Bhabha later links to a non-place, “Beginnings require an originary non-place, something unspoken which then produces a chronology of events. Beginnings can, in this sense, be the narrative limits of the knowable, the margins of the meaningful” (146). It is the project of this map to read for that non-place beginning, to discern how urbanization haunts Moré, how it allows him certain degree of success while also appropriating his actions and reproducing the conditions of marginalization at a systematic level. </p>

        <h3>Alibag: Mobility through Poeple as Infrastructure</h3>
        <center><image src="https://josdchavez.github.io/rbMore/images/mahad_satyagraha.jpg"></center>
        <p>Moré received his education in Dasgaon until he travelled to Alibag for an examination that earned him a 3 year scholarship at an English school in Mahad. If Moré’s academic career is to be understood as the way he successfully combatted untouchability early in his life, one must acknowledge how much this success depended on the social relations around him, especially with others Mahars. He describes how he was sent to Alibag for this examination by one of his teachers, ”a Brahman called Ramchandra Keshav Khare” (8) who did not practice untouchability and who would visit him when he was ill. To buy appropriate clothing to take the exam, he goes to Tale accompanied by a maternal cousin of his father and to get to Alibag he goes on a 3 day journey on foot with his cousin Namdeo who “knew everything we needed to know…how long it would take to reach Alibag and by which route, and also when the examination was due to start and to end” (10). The way in which the teachers and cousins helped Moré access Alibag can be understood under the rubric of people as infrastructure, described by AbdouMalique Simone on her essay “People as Infrastructure: Intersecting Fragments in Johannesburg” as a way to emphasize the “economic collaboration among residents seemingly marginalized from and immiserated by urban life.” More’s account can be understood as a story about people as infrastructure, the ways in which the collaborations he sustained negotiated marginalization by helping him receive an education. Alibag is an early example not only of how people as infrastructure allowed Moré access to resources to fund his schooling, but how people as infrastructure was a way to survive physically and emotionally through the hostility of caste prejudice: “During this journey of three days, I had the bitter experience that because we belonged to the Mahar caste people scorned us, treated us with contempt, insulted us and oppressed us, and my heart was distressed. Alibag was known throughout the Colaba district as a very orthodox and first-class misanthropic town. There even shadows were thought to be polluting. When we reached there we went to the home of a gentleman in the Mahar colony outside the town” (10). People as infrastructure is not just a matter of access to economic resources but it is a matter of surviving through the deterioration that comes about with caste discrimination. By sharing resources (addresses of people in other villages, anecdotal information about the routes, etc.), Moré becomes embedded in a web of social and economic relations between seemingly disparate locations, forming a spatial network of survival amid precarity.</p>

        <h3>First Visit to Bombay: Re-territorialization of Rural Relations into Urban Space </h3>
        <center><image src="https://josdchavez.github.io/rbMore/images/dockyard_chipping.png"></center>
		<p>The same spatial network of people as infrastructure allows a re-territorialization of the rural into the urban, connecting recently arrived migrants to already existing communities that resemble those from home while simultaneously transforming caste relations into a form of spatial segregation during early 20th century Bombay. The re-territorialization is a condition of possibility for people as infrastructure to distribute resources while also a way for caste relations to be maintained in the absence of a traditional untouchability practice rendered impossible by the built form of the city. On arriving to Bombay after Alibag, Moré remarks: “This area of chawls was known as Family Lines. A large number of military pensioners and other Mahar people lived in these Family Lines. We went to stay with our relatives who lived there” (11). While I will expand on this point later on since Moré makes similar remarks at multiple different locations, for now, it is important to note that the re-territorialization of the rural suggests a necessary flexibility to the people as infrastructure in order to be able to combat the gratuitiousness of discrimination that can happen anytime, anywhere as seen by the refusal from the English school in Mahad to enroll Moré even after he obtained a scholarship: “I was told that they were willing to take me into the school, but Dharap, who was the owner of the school building had told them, ‘If you admit a Mahar boy into the school I will not rent my building to you’” (13).</p>

        <h3>Return to Ladawali and Going to School in Mahad: More becomes an Activist</h3>
        <image src="">
		<p>When 11-year-old Moré is refused enrollment from the school, he begins his activist career. He returns to Ladawali where he meets playwright Yashwant Narayan Tipnis and either Govind Gopal Tipnis or Anant Vinayak Chitré - all of whom were family friends involved in anti-caste protest thought. They help him write and publish a letter denouncing the school on the basis of caste discrimination: “They said that since I had won a government scholarship, the school at Mahaad would have to admit me. After that they dictated some things for me to write down on a piece of paper. I wrote it down and when I went home I copied it on to a postcard and sent the card to an address that they had given me” (14). The letter is effective since he “was called to the school” (14). The infrastructure the family friends and Moré produce through their exchange becomes crucial for a successful negotiation with untouchability, allowing him access to a new village: Mahad.</p>
		<p>In Mahad, Moré further develops his political consciousness, as seen by his community organizing to open up a tea shop for Mahars to have drinking water while traveling through: “All except the Mahaars could quench their thirst by asking the shopkeepers for water or going to the Mahaad lake. But the Mahaar people were reduced to a pitiable state in this regard. My heart became heavily burdened when I saw the cruel derision I have described above, to which they were subjected by well-to-do passers-by, and their problems in getting water to drink” (16). Addressing this cruel derision is the first time in the memoir where we see Moré actively becoming part of the people of infrastructure for a community concern: “I called a meeting in the Mahaar wada in Mahaad one day. Mahaar people from various villages in the Mahaad precinct were present at the meeting. After discussion it was decided that a tea shop would be set up in a field near the wagon yard. A condition was to be imposed that the person running the teashop would have to provide drinking water free of charge to our people…My going to the Mahaad school was, at least in Mahaad, a victory for the movement against untouchability” (17-18). By saying that his going to school was a victory for the movement against untouchability he is further linking his life to caste critique, sustaining the rhetorical intertwinement which he used to start narrating his life in terms of an explicit class-caste critique that takes place at the level of the memoir and its writing but also at the level of the events that describe how people as infrastructure allows for survival.</p>
		<p>If More’s memoir can be read as an account of people as infrastructure, it allows itself to be read for that infrastructure’s disposition. On “Extrastatecraft: The Power of Infrastructure Space,” Keller Easterling describes disposition as the place where the contradiction lies, between what the infrastructure says it’s doing and what it is actually doing. What does it mean to read for the disposition of people as infrastructure in Moré’s account? It means to uncover “accidental, covert, or stubborn forms of power” hiding behind it. Easterling’s emphasis on the stubborn forms of power behind infrastructure space is useful in relation to the issue of urbanization as it allows us to think about the contradictions present in the text in order to flesh out the operations of power. Because it is power that disposition seeks to render visible, I argue that in the textual moments of primitive accumulation, moments where Moré’s actions, relations and resources become appropriated by what we can retroactively call a logic of urbanization, is where we can see how power constitutes lived, conceived and perceived space at the level of the everyday. The moment of primitive accumulation that surfaces on the text quite frequently is the constant hardship Moré’s mother had to experience at the hands of her dead husband's cousins. The cousins had housed More's mother after her husband death but were also stealing from her any surplus income that came in vis-a-vis Moré: “Every month or two she would take me on a trip to Dasgaon and check what still remained and what had gone from our belongings. Whenever she discovered that rafters from the roof or materials for construction and carpentry work had disappeared, she would blame the people from the big house. They would treat me with affection and quarrel with my mother. Nobody paid heed to her protests and exhortation” (13). The affection they showed Moré was also a way to secure the money from his scholarship to them, “My mother was not happy about [him spending all his time between Dasgaon and Mahad]. But the people from the big house in Dasgaon would call me there with a show of affection and I, out of diffidence, would not go against their word. Later, when I began to get my five rupee per month scholarship, that money would go to them” (19). The moment of corruption (the paternal family taking the money from More and from his mother) is a moment of primitive accumulation, funding the lifestyle of the big house family which were described earlier as being the center of social life in Dasgaon. These side comments about his mother offer a glimpse on how the further entrenching of marginalization happens along other axes of power such as gender. Whereas he can easily take advantage of people as infrastructure, the activities he exerts through it are still able to dispossess along intersecting lines of class-caste-gender that make the dispossession most intensely and continuously felt by his mother.</p>

        <h3>Back in Dasgaon and Charai: The Re-territorialization of Dispossession On Gender </h3>
        <center><image src=""></center>
        <p>Moré eventually also experiences the dispossession taking place under the stealing of his scholarship money when the scholarship runs out a year before it was supposed. During the year that elapsed between the English school refusal of his enrolment and the publishing of the letter, the big house family kept taking all of the scholarship money. However, Moré's felt dispossession happens at a different degree of intensity from his mother who must negotiate with it daily. Her only income was “to collect firewood, chop it into small pieces, then tie it up with plant fibres and bring it home, and finally make small bundles to sell in that village or the next” (20). The fact that it is his mother who experiences the everyday precarity exacerbated by the big house’s corruption even when Moré himself is not really affected until later demonstrates that his actions, even when trying to combat untouchability, can easily be re-appropriated by the interlocking systems of oppression that inflict themselselves along the gender axis of power, allowing Moré to have a perceived improvement in combating untouchability at least in his own experience. Gender as a determinant for the intensity of dispossession is also seen through the paternal’s family decision to marry Moré to his cousin in the advent of him moving to Bombay for work since he cannot continue his education. The family marries him as a way to secure remittances to themselves, the job as a replacement for the scholarship money: “Neither I nor my mother were enthused to hear that my marriage had been arranged. My mind was distressed because I had had to leave school for lack of money, and my mother was always tense because of her widowhood and the trials she had to suffer” (21). Even after More becomes agreeable to the marriage, his wife can be understood as another victim of the violence that takes place along the lines of gender in the deployment of people as infrastructure since a) she completely disappears from the narrative after the brief mention of their marriage and b) she is merely functioning as a way to make sure Moré will keep sending money back to Dasgaon. In considering the way dispossession operates along the lines of gender, we can see how the disposition of people as infrastructure is a continuation of marginalization through spatial relations that immobilize certain gendered bodies.</p>
	<p>In Charai, Moré does not recount much about his bride’s family but instead focuses on his relationship with a thief, an episode that allows us to start thinking who exactly are the people in the people of infrastructure we are talking about, people who are also marginalized, not necessarily along lines of caste but other social prejudices. His wife’s father, a rich landowner called Putalya Mahaar Patil, admired a thief in the Tale region called Chandrya Kaatkari: “He was much talked about. Rich people and government officials lived in fear of him. If anyone tormented the poor too much, he would teach them a lesson. He had a kind of hold over the khot moneylenders. The police could never lay their hands on him” (23). When Moré mentions he wanted to go to Tale to see the jatra, his father-in-law enlists Chandrya to take him: “It was two or three days later that I learnt from Dada that the person who had carried me on his shoulders through the forest was a well-known robber of those parts. It was only when I became acquainted with Marxism as an adult that I understood why brave and decent people like Chandrya become robbers” (23). Like Moré, Chandra is a marginalized subject who steals not to create urbanized land like the moneylenders in Dasgaon but if “anyone tormented the poor too much, he would teach them a lesson” (23).  From the thief’s behavior one can see that the affiliation between the people as infrastructure comes from a shared sense of marginalization from the larger social order. Given that Moré mentions how he only understood his behavior after being exposed to Marxism, it shows that this moment of solidarity is not happening only through a lens of anti-caste thought but also through a visceral, heterodox understanding of class exploitation.</p>

    	<h3>Second Visit To Bombay: Ambedkar, the Army, Prostitutes and Tamasha Players</h3>
        <center><image src=""></center>
	<p>After the remittance-marriage is secured, Moré is sent to Bombay under the promise of a family friend who said he’ll get him a job as tax collector. It does not materialize. In its absence, Moré’s description of his time in Bombay underlines the importance of the re-territorialization of the rural into the urban space as it facilitates relationships of familiarity and contingency that help him negotiate emotional distress and the material conditions of the city: “I had been staying with a distant relative in a chawl in Family Lines. We used to call his mother Aka. I and three or four others from Daasgaon were staying at Aka’s place” (25). Moré is not only constantly returning to the same space of Bombay but he is constantly surrounded by people from where he came from, a familiarity that encouraged affective relationships of trust and solidarity amid destitution, “It was four or five months since I had arrived and I had still not found a job. So I was not able to pay for my food. Nobody rebuked me, rather I was showered with affection.” (25). The familiarity allows Moré to be easily introduced to organized frameworks of thought surrounding marginalization. It is during his first visit to Bombay when, “I saw Dr. Ambedkar for the first time. Seeing Dr. Ambedkar made me acutely aware of the importance of getting an education” (25). By being with Aká in Family Chawls, Moré was embedded in a thick social life that introduced figures like Ambedkar, who start functioning diegetically and extra-diegetically as a role model for his own moral and political aspirations. Recognizing the importance of Ambedkar within the memoir demonstrantes Moré’s awareness of the importance his thought had in helping him develop his own thinking about class. With his meeting of Ambedkar, we can start thinking about Moré’s conscious fashioning of the text as a bildungsroman caste-class critique since Ambedkar gives Moré the language to think caste along class, introducing him to more orthodox thinking surrounding class exploitation that shapes the memoir itself as an aesthetic object.</p>
	<p>Ambedkar as a role model for Moré’s aspirations, for who he wants to be and how he imagines reform, shapes the way Moré begins to narrate his affective ties towards other contingent actors within the narrative, actors that give him access to money and other social spaces such as theater even if they are constructed as “bad:” “Most of the people living there earned their living doing some work connected with the army. (25) Just then someone told me about a job; it was for just a month and a half, a leave vacancy, but the wages were forty-five rupees” (25). This moment is one of re-territorialization where the dynamics described earlier as allowing access to Mahars in Dapoli and Dasgaon to economic improvement repeat themselves in the city, creating a form of “universal knowledge” shared around the people as infrastructure: wherever Moré goes, he kind of knows the army can always provide him a job. The army opens up Moré’s social life to a wider range of contingent actors where the reader can start seeing how his aspirations begin to construe certain people within the infrastructure as “bad” even while enjoying their company and relying on them for survival: “when I started going to work at Haji Bandar I became familiar with some new areas of Bombay…Later on I began to go to these areas Moré and Moré often. This was because three of my new-found companions were taking part in the Kamleshwar Drama Company…The Batatyachi Chawl where our theatre room was located was in the Safed Galli (literally, white lane). This Safed Galli was a big centre of the prostitution business…Prostitutes lived in some of the rooms in Batatyachi Chawl and tamasha players and other people lived in the remaining rooms. My friends kept a distance from bad things. This was because they were educated and cultured. Their attraction to the art of the theatre can be said to be a sign of their being cultured. This was their way of trying to rise from a lower class to a higher class” (28-29). By entering new areas of the city that are not as familiar to Moré as part of the network of people as infrastructure (“some new areas of Bombay, Safed Galli, Batatyachi Chawl”), he is introduced to social actors who are construed as undesirable not along class or caste but through the figures of the “prostitute” or the “addict.” By narrating the “prostitute/smoker/gambler” as separate from his tamasha friends doing “high art” despite the likeliness that many of the people surrounding him were probably doing both (the “bad and the good things” as implied), Moré narrates himself as a character that is somewhat distant from the social life he is describing even if he depended on it at the everyday level. The distance is also a signifier for his adherence to what’s “good:” educating oneself like Ambedkar did. In adopting Ambedkar as role model, Ambedkar begins to function diegetically and extra-diegetically as what shapes Moré’s understanding of what is understood as “good,” of who is understood as “the people.”</p>

        <h3>Arrival to Pune: The Alegaonkar High School and the Distance from "Bad Things"</h3>
	<center><image src=""></center>
        <p>Moré’s aspirations for his life turn Ambedkar into a moral prerogative for reform. It is what allows Moré to narrate some of the people within the people as infrastructure as “friends” and others as somewhat distanced from Moré’s understanding of a good life. When he arrives to Pune, his narration repeats the pattern described earlier with Bombay: the “universality” of the re-territorialization of rural relations into urban spaces is seen when Moré realizes the family members he knew in Pune knew nothing about the city except for army-related spaces: “their knowledge was limited to the cantonment area of Puné…They said, “We have nothing to do with Poona city. We hardly ever go there.” Even the children of the Modi Khana area did not go to school with children from the city. There were separate schools for these children in the vicinity. Just as in Bombay I had lived in the Family Lines meant for army people, so did I find myself among military people in Modi Khana. In the villages there were separate areas for our folk. I felt that even in Bombay and Puné there were separate colonies for us, but I did not at the time understand who had separated us in this way” (32). More’s quoting of what “they” said gives a referential authority to his text that serves as indicting evidence against those who he now (his “now” being at the time of writing) understands as being the culprits for spatial segregation along caste lines: those practicing untouchability. However, while living the spatial segregation and before he could understand the pattern he was experiencing as such, it functioned as a mental map of the places that Moré could go to negotiate precarity. The cantonment (like the docks in Bombay) provided him a job as Hindi-English translator between sergeant and prisoners, with a good enough income to send money back home (always stolen from the mother by his relatives) and to pay for the Alegaonkar Night High School he enrolled in. The arsenal also exposed him to contingent social actors: some who gave Moré shelter after leaving the relatives he distrusted, others who shared the vices Moré understood as “bad.” Moré’s idea of “bad” becomes the limits of his reform and what determines who in the narrative becomes legible as a friend and who is just a distant other: “Some of the persons working with me at the Arsenal had become my friends. Now to these were added friends from  among the students of the Alegaonkars’ school.  Some of these friends liked to go and see tamashas and plays. Some loved to sing bhajans, some liked gambling and playing cards, while others had a liking for physical exercise, running and other sports. I spent what time I could with all of them and won their affection. Because of their company I picked up some bad habits. But I did not become addicted to them. The reading I had done earlier and and the company of saintly persons had given me a meditative nature…From the time I began to go to night school, I avoided spending too much time with my friends who were fond of tamashas, plays, cards, and gambling. Gradually I became detached from all these things” (36). In transforming the figure of Ambedkar into a moral prerogative for reform through an enshrinement of education that determines who he will gradually distance from, Moré denies the possibility for other lifestyles to also be capable of reform, for those “bad” people to also be characters in their own right. What is at stakes with that denial is that it leaves unaddressed the larger structural issue that Moré’s adopted tactic has not been able to attend, the fact that his aspiration and the money it is funding it keeps effecting a dispossession of Mahars (his own mother) along the axis of gender difference. By denying the possibility that lifestyles different from what  Ambedkar espoused can lead to legitimate forms of reform, his work and thinking stays within the limits of the class and caste thought traditions he inherited even as he is transforming them. The limits is what structure the narrative of those people as “friends” and those he “distances from.”</p>

        <h3>Bombay for the Third Time: The Imaginary of Labor and Reform</h3>
	<center><image src=""></center>
        <p>Ambedkar is not the only figure that stands for his understanding of education as reform. Tilak and theater are figures within the text that mobilize Moré from Pune back to Bombay as symbolically furthering his education into a “higher class,” even if immiseration is catalyzed through his very same actions. They form an imaginary that prioritizes education and renders others not following it legible as “friends” only in the context of labor. He arrives to Bombay on a special train arranged exclusively for those who wanted to attend Bombay for Tilak’s procession and after the procession, instead of going back to his relatives, he decides to go to a play, an activity he has already associated with trying to rise to a higher class. In doing this, Moré constructs the relatives in Family Chawl as those who aren’t rising; he sets himself apart. The play ends late and he decides to sleep on the Bhatia Gardens (now the circle in front of Asia Society) where his money and possession get stolen. He does not return to his family but rather tries to earn back the money he lost by working on the docks, “Sometimes I could not get work for as long as four days. At such times I would barely eat something with the help of my friends at work. My friends too were like me. We helped each other as friends and accomplices” (40). The imaginary Moré weaves around reform and education allow him to narrate his solidarity with others as “friends and accomplices” only in the context of labor, only when he is also poor and working. In other words, he inherits and reproduces the caveats of orthodox caste-class thinking that fail to imagine reform and struggle outside the figure of the worker, foreclosing other potential figures such as a the prostitute or the mother.</p>

        <h3>Returning to Mahad: The Tea-Shop as a Space for Political Action</h3>
        The limitations of Moré’s imaginary can be seen at work when he returns to Mahad and turns the tea shop into a center for political action. Even while describing his work of community organizing at a regional level, Moré acknowledges how this did not address his mother’s immiseration caused by the corruption amid his family members and continued by his own acquiescence. After returning to Dasgaon, Moré works briefly as a teacher until he earns enough money to enroll back and finish his degree in Mahad. Moré describes how “that tea-shop” he had help open up had become “a virtual information centre for a circle of about sixty square miles around Mahaad. Raigad, Pratapgad and the villages of the valley come within that circle” (46). Given the influx of Mahars, Moré utilized the resources of people as infrastructure to make “a decision of historical importance: to hold a conference of the Colaba District Outcaste Association in Mahaad under the chairmanship of Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar. The heads of caste panchayats were entrusted with the responsibility of collecting three rupees a head from each and every village, to cover the expenses of holding the conference. Now a new air of enthusiasm sprang up among the untouchable youth in the marketplace. Everywhere there was talk about the prospect of Ambedkar Saheb coming to Mahaad for a big gathering” (49-50). Despite the efforts to have this conference in order to bring attention to the social standing of Mahars, Moré mentions how this prevented him from being home and allowed a continued exploitation of his mother. He even becomes complicit through affective manipulation: “Because I was caught in the deceitful net of false affection that the people at the big house cast over me, and I still did not have the courage to break out of it. I behaved just as those people asked me to behave. They, rather than my mother, exerted their authority over me” (42). The stark contrast suggests that Moré’s mother and their relationship to the corruption of the big house family cannot be narrated and understood under the rubric of political action as easily as access to water can. The conference is understood as a success if one ignores its inability to help the mother and others in a similar situation like her. In describing his organizing efforts side by side with his mother’s suffering, Moré’s text points ever so slightly towards the limitations of his own imagination of what reform is and what a legitimate field of political action can be. It underlines how issues related to gender are constantly left out from possibility of change, how political action revolves around an imagined male victim, which allows attention to be deflected from the ways in which urbanization and the very actions that seem to enact reform are re-territorializing themselves, how the stubborn forms of power behind Moré’s activism can still enact accumulation by dispossession through his mother, through the impossibility of gender as commensurable with labor in the theoretical framework he has adopted from Ambedkar.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion: Return to Bombay and the financing of Mahad Conference</h3>
	<center><image src=""></center>
        <p>The narration of what Moré had to do to materialize the Mahar conference not only allows us to see the contradiction of Moré’s actions (the ways they are re-appropriated)  in relation to gender difference, but also how even Ambedkar exhibits contradictory behavior towards certain subjects, a behavior that constructs them in the periphery of change as actors lacking the ability for self-determination. When Moré goes to Bombay to try to secure funding for the conference, he meets Ambedkar for a second time who “inquired about where I lived, what I did, how far I had studied and so on, and expressed his satisfaction. He then said to me, “You don’t know what people of the Konkan are like. They are very obstinate. They will always say, what we do is as it should be. They will say, who is this Christ-lover coming here telling us what to do? And they won’t listen to me.” To which I answered, “Saheb, they listen to me so they will certainly listen to you.” In the end he said, “I have no time just now. Come back during the Diwali vacations and we will see what we can do.” (50). Ambedkar justifies his reluctance by saying how “obstinate” the people of Konkan are, mobilizing this adjective like More previously utilized notions of prostitution, gambling and addiction to dismiss certain people. Even when Moré argues against his excuse by saying that if they listen to him, they’ll listen to Ambedkar, Moré’s response still constructs the people of Konkan as docile followers; they are imagined as “people” insofar as they require the help of self-fashioned leaders like them. He then meets with Ambedkar’s brother and others in the Social Service League who encourage him to organize the conference and help him craft the plan of putting up a play and use tickets sales to fund it. However, they refuse to help him sell the tickets: “when it came to the question of selling tickets, he flatly refused to sell the tickets himself or to get someone else to sell them, pointing to the people’s bad habits and addictions” (51).  “Bad habits and addictions” function within the narrative space similarly to gender insofar as they are determinants of subjects who can carry out reform and who can be incorporated into action. Ironically, these same people with bad habits and addictions have helped Moré survive and they are the people he relies on to sell the tickets: “I went to meet three friends of mine who lived in the servants’ quarters of St. George Hospital in the Fort area. I told them about all this business of selling tickets for the play. All three of them were working as uniformed guards or peons. Two of them were barely literate and the third had passed the fourth standard examination in Marathi school. With the help of these friends I managed to sell some four-anna tickets and about twenty eight-anna and ten-anna tickets.” (51). The conference in the village of Mahad becomes possible only through the socio-economic relations in urbanized spaces like Bombay. His organized political action thus relies on urbanization to combat precarity while ignoring the way in which this same urbanization inflicts new forms of immiseration along different axes of power beyond caste-class, including gender and mobilization of certain undesired subject positions like the prostitute, the addict, the bum. Moré’s adoption of Ambedkar as role model gave him the language to articulate his caste-class critique but also shaped the limits of his imagination, replicating the same caveats Ambedkar’s own thought produced, which included ignorance about  how the dispossession by urbanization transforms itself so that it is felt more intensely by certain others while allowing a privileged subaltern to perceive improvement.</p>
