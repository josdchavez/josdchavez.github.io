        <p>QUOTES: "The first capital of the Marathi state in modern times was Raaigad. It was in the village of Laadawali in the precinct of this same Raaigad that I was born, at dawn on a Sunday on the second day of the lunar month, in the year 1903 C.E. The night of the Chhabina of Viroba at Mahaad was drawing to an end." (1) "Along with them, brandishing their long poles of bamboo with red, green, yellow and white streamers tied to them, walk thousands of sturdy people of all castes, shouting out chants of Harahar Mahaadev, forgetting all caste distinctions and untouchability." "Only in the homes of Mahaars, not those of people of any other caste. Because these gods, especially Bhairi and Kalkai, are originally the Mahaars’ gods, and after that they are the gods of all the villagers" The reason I have talked about the Chhabina of Viroba and the different gods taking part in the jatra when I told of the time of my birth, is to make it clear that people do not distinguish between touchable and untouchable on these occasions." (2) " And it is the social reformers, political leaders and so-called thinkers who, even though they understood the importance of the problem of untouchability, followed those persons from the upper castes, and beat the drum of the national independence struggle for years on end, with the result that untouchability did not end and the oppressed, exploited majority of the Indian people never attained real national independence. When we say today that our nation is independent, it means that it is no longer under the rule of foreign British rulers, but now it is dominated by our own landlords and capitalists"</p>

        <p>Quotes: “My elder brother and sister were already married and they had died. And all the land, estate, and wealth that he had accumulated through his own efforts had been lost in the court cases filed against him by the Muslim Khot moneylenders from around Dasgaon (3) “At this time he became a poor farmer who had enough land to provide for himself. By working his own land, he could meet the needs of his family. This went on till I was eight or nine years old, and then, becoming the victim of a moneylender’s treachery, he lost all his own land. This is how it happened: the moneylender sweet-talked him into signing a blank piece of paper, and then he wrote on it that my father had sold his land. Of course the moneylender became owner of that land, and my father, the former owner, became a mere tenant. Inevitably then, it was up to the landowner’s whim whether he would allow my father to go on working the land as a tenant, and in the end the expected happened.  One day the moneylender evicted my father from that land for good, and he was obliged to live the painful  life of a landless labourer. This happened when  my father’s death was two or three years away. One cannot imagine what a devastating jolt this was for him.” (3-4) “When I was five or six years old I began to attend the Marathi school in Dasgaon. At the time, in the entire Konkan region, there was no village Marathi school for Dalits other than the school in Dasgaon.” (4) “The few untouchable folk in the Konkan who managed to get an education in those days did it through being in the military. The children of military pensioners went to schools in cities like Puné, Bombay and Satara. The only village school giving an education to untouchable children was and is in Dasgaon: nowhere else” (4) “The reason for Dasgaon and the Dasgaon school gaining such importance is that it was  a port for small boats, surrounded by mountains with crags and cliffs, covered with terrifying  dense forests inhabited by all kinds of wild animals including tigers.” (4) “Dasgaon had become a point of transit joining Dapoli military camp with Bombay. Dasgaon also became a place of retirement for military pensioners staying at Dapoli. With Dasgaon already having the strength of local unity, and with the support of high-ranked military officers who were also their brethren, nobody would dare to cross them, or have the nerve to take away the rights that they had attained.” (5)</p>

        <p>QUOTES: "When I was ill he visited our house once or twice, and sat down on the cot where I was sleeping to inquire after me affectionately. In 1914 he sent me to Alibag to appear for the high school scholarship examination for under-elevens that was held at the district centre. I passed in the first rank among Moré  than two hundred students who appeared for the exam, and was awarded a government scholarship of five rupees a month" (8) "When we reached Talé my uncle bought me a new outfit for going to Alibag and sent me back to Dasgaon. When I came to Dasgaon my father had fallen ill and was confined to his bed." (9) "At a time  when my father was at death’s door and my mother  had just risen from childbed, there was not a morsel of food in our house.  Why was a man who had  a field with six ploughs, who had arranged the marriages of about twenty people from the Kunbi, Bhoi, and Mulsim communities with his own money, reduced to such a condition at the moment of death? The real cause of this tragic situation was my father’s extreme unselfishness and the usurious noose of the British imperialists."(9) "My uncle took my mother and sister to Ladawali and Namdeo dada set out for Alibag with me. We took with us enough bhakari and chatni to last us for three days. Namdeo dada was another maternal cousin of my father’s and he too was a schoolmaster. He knew everything we needed to know about the jouney: how long it would take to reach Alibag and by which route, and also when the examination was due to start and to end. In those days we had to complete the whole journey on foot. We started out from Dasgaon in the morning and made a night stop at Indapur." (10) "During this journey of three days, I had the bitter experience that because we belonged to the Mahar caste people scorned us, treated us with contempt, insulted us and oppressed us, and my heart was distressed.	Alibag was known throughout the Colaba district as a very orthodox and first-class misanthropic town. There even shadows were thought to be polluting. When we reached there we went to  the home of a gentleman in the Mahar colony outside the town" (10) The question paper was tossed to me from a distance and when I had finished writing my paper, I pushed it forward. It was picked up from there and taken away. All this was carried out with the utmost care to avoid touching me at any point." (11)</p>

		<p>QUOTES: "In Bombay, a squat set of chawls had been built along the road leading to Carnac Bridge, between Musafirkhana and Crawford Market. This area of chawls was known as Family Lines.  A large number of military pensioners and other Mahar people lived in these Family Lines. We went to stay with our relatives who lived there."(11)"In our house at Dagsaon there were still pots and pans and and other baggage belonging to us,  and my mother kept her eye on them. Every month or two she would take me on a trip to Dasgaon and check what still remained and what had gone from our belongings. Whenever she discovered that rafters from the roof or materials for construction and carpentry work had disappeared, she would blame the people from the big house. They would treat me with affection and quarrel with my mother. Nobody paid heed to her protests and exhortations. While we were living in Ladawali,  I once got a summons from Dasgaon. I went there and found that the school had informed us that I had passed with first rank in the examination at Alibag. The government had awarded me a scholarship of five rupees a month to attend the English school. Hearing this, the people from the big house made much of me. They seemed even fonder of me than before.  I was also extremely happy to learn that from June I would be going to the English school in Mahaad. I became impatient for the two months in between to pass so that I could  go to the English school. The English school at Mahaad had been established before I was born and was in a one-story building opposite the post and telegraph office. This building belonged to a well-known Brahman family with the name of Dharap and had been  leased out to the school. When the school opened in June I went and met the schoolmaster and asked him to put my name on the rolls. He took down my details and asked me to return after a week. When I went back after a week I was told that they were willing to take me into the school, but Dharap, who was the owner of the school building had told them, “If you admit a Mahar boy into the school I will not rent my building to you.” (12-3) </p>

		<p>QUOTES: I would lose myself completely in this singing and dancing. I was able to tell stories and also to read from the holy books. So the people of Ladawali would make much of me.  All the people from my  mama’s (maternal uncle’s) colony would invite me to eat in their homes. I had uncles, grandmothers,  aunts in every house. I did not know how the rainy season passed in that atmosphere of love and affection. (13) They asked me several questions to get information about me.  I answered their questions. They said that since I had won a government scholarship, the school at Mahaad would have to admit me. After that they dictated some things for me to write down on a piece of paper. I wrote it down and when I went home I copied it on to  a postcard and sent the card to an address that they had given me. Within a month I received a message from the school; I was called to the school and the matter I had written on the postcard had been published in a newspaper under my name. This was shown to me and I was asked, “Did you write this?” I said yes. There was a great commotion among the teachers and pupils of the school. One said, “ Such a small boy and what nerve he has. He asks for the school’s grant to be stopped!” From another came the remark,   “This is why we have to keep these people at a distance”. Some teachers and boys were glaring at me. After all this, the headmaster told me to come to school from Monday. – “We have decided to take your name on the rolls of this school.” I returned to Dasgaon and recounted what had happened. The teachers in Dasgaon, and others, were very happy to hear it and congratulated me. I came to Ladawali, thanked Bhikoba and asked who his two guests were. He said, they are my brothers. When  it was learned that t one of them was a famous playwright of Maharashtra, Yashwant Narayan Tipnis. I could not find out exactly about the other. He was probably Govind Gopal Tipnis or Anant Vinayak Chitré.  (14-15) Before I was admitted to the Mahaad school I had been living in Ladawali, and after this too I stayed on at Ladawali and went daily to the school which was a mile or two away. In the Mahar community widespread tales were told about the perfidious machinations of Brahmans and other upper castes, and so the whole community had become suspicious.  When I started going to school in Mahaad my mother gave me strict warnings.  She would say,  “Don’t eat anything that anyone gives you, don’t drink their water”, and even, “Don’t eat so much as a paan, they might put anything inside it and take your life.” Our classes started at ten or eleven in the morning and went on till five in the evening. From the time I had a meal at  home and left for school in the morning till I returned home, I would not touch a morsel of food. (16) The real problem arose for the poor people who came to the marketplace from far off. Among them all except the Mahaars could quench their thirst by asking the shopkeepers for water or going to the Mahaad lake. But the Mahaar people were reduced to a pitiable state in this regard. My heart became heavily burdened when I saw the cruel derision I have described above, to which they were subjected by well-to-do passers-by, and their problems in getting water to drink. The  people from the Raaigad valley who came to Mahaad, parched with thirst, would get water only when they came to the river at Laadawali or Kinjoli.  (16) And from this came the idea of starting a teashop in the place where carts were parked, to solve the problem of drinking water. It was to explain this idea to a few important people that I called a meeting in the Mahaar wada  in Mahaad one day. Mahaar people from various villages in the Mahaad precinct were present at the meeting. After discussion it was decided that a tea shop would be set up in a field near the wagon yard. A condition was to be imposed that the person running the teashop would have to provide drinking water free of charge to our people. (17) My going to the Mahaad school was, at least in Mahaad, a victory for the movement against untouchability (18) This was an adda, a gathering-place, for us in the marketplace. In the beginning nobody would stay there at night. But after some time some persons would stay there even at night (18) . In reality, what was the need for me to go to Dashaon every Saturday when my mother and sister were at Laadawali? My mother was not happy about this. But the people from the big house in Dasgaon  would call me there with a show of affection and I, out of diffidence, would not go against their word. Later, when I began  to get my five rupee per month scholarship, that money would go to them (19) .  I was informed by the school that I would not get the scholarship money from then on. What happened to the three years’ scholarship?  The third year was probably counted as the time which was wasted before I was admitted to the school. While I was going to school the small expenditure that was required for my uniform, books and so on, was taken from my scholarship money. But if I was not getting the scholarship the question arose as to who would undertake that expense. Our people in Dasgaon who had taken ascholar’s money were not willing to spend now, and my uncle was already hard pressed to support us on his meagre income. In this situation, my mother said, whatever happens we must go and live in our house in Dasgaon now (19) </p>

        <p>QUOTES: "She did all the work in the house, but she had not worked outside in the fields. But now after we returned to Dasgaon she started to go outto collect firewood, chop it into small pieces, then tie it up with plant fibres and bring it home, and finally make small  bundles to sell in that village or the next village, and bring back   food or money in exchange.  This was the subsistence occupation of many poor persons in Dasgaon.  The forest of Dasgaon was the only means of livelihood and sustenance for them. I too used to go with other children to collect twigs. Once when we had gone to the forest like this, a forest guard tried to catch three boys of my age and a young man, confiscate their sickles and take them to the police chowkie" (20) When I had left school and was living in Dasgaon collecting firewood and doing odd jobs for the big house, a guest from Bombay came to the big house. He asked me how far I had studied, what I was doing, and so on and after this he told my four Dadas--- my father’s maternal cousins --- that if they sent Ramchandra (me) to Bombay he would secure for me a job as ticket collector with a monthly salary of forty-five rupees. At the time all these brothers were teachers in the Mahar school and they were earning eleven rupees a month. They reckoned: the four of us together earn four times eleven or forty-four rupees, and Ramchandra on his own is going to get a rupee Moré  than that! ---`so they decided that they would send Ramchandra to Bombay to become a collector (20) Neither I nor my mother were enthused to hear that my marriage had been arranged.  My mind was distressed because I had had to leave school for lack of money, and my mother was always tense because of her widowhood and the trials she had to suffer. My marriage was taking place in this situation. What could we say other than---“Fine, let it happen” --? If the people from the big house taunted her on the subject of  my marriage, she would say,  my boy is not yet old enough to be married. If you don’t want to arrange his marriage don’t do it, but don’t bother me with claims of your generosity. Of course, this business of her son, with no one to look after him, getting married, was in fact something that made her glad; and as for me, why should I not like the idea of getting married? To sum up, both my mother and I were agreeable to the marriage. We were happy that this marriage was taking place. The person whose daughter I was going to marry had great affection for my father. My father had tried hard to rescue him from the ill-treatment he was subjected to by his stepmother. And so he always remained grateful to my father (21) This plan was as follows: adjoining the classroom where the third standard had classes, was a window about two and a half to three feet high. A platform was to be erected outside  this window. I was to ascend this platform with the help of a small ladder, so that I could face the class and be in communication with the teacher and my classmates, and could learn my lessons without touching other children in my class or in the school.  Dada, my father-in-law, agreed to this plan and four workmen were hired at once to build the platform. They cut down branches from a nanduki tree in the school compound and under Dada’s guidance built the platform in two days.  After this, Dada took me to see the school, my classroom and the place where I was to sit.  When I saw the whole setup I told Dada that I was not prepared to learn my lessons sitting on a stage outside the school building.  --- “In the Mahaad school they used to seat me separately outside the classroom, but at least the place was inside the school building. Here they are making me sit on a stage on the barren land behind the building , I don’t like it at all.” (22) , I was taken to Charai, a village near Talé, as a guest. My wife’s grandfather lived there. His name was Putalaji and he owned land which had a yield of almost a thousand rupees. At that time he was the Police patil of the village. Even in the rainy season there were twenty  to forty sheaves of rice remaining in his granary. Four or five big pots of milk would come to the house every day. He was that rich. His sons and daughters had come to Dasgaon for the wedding buthedid not himself attend. We were taken to Charai to see him. He and his wife welcomed us and made much of us. (22) He was much talked about. Rich people and government officials lived in fear of him. If anyone tormented the poor too much, he would teach them a lesson. He had a kind of hold over the khot moneylenders. The police could never lay their hands on him (23) . It was two or three days later that I learnt from Dada that the person who had carried me on his shoulders through the forest was a well-known robber of those parts. It was only when I became acquainted with Marxism as an adult that I understood why brave and decent people like Chandrya become robbers. (23) </p>

	<p>QUOTES: Just as I recovered from this injury I was sent to Bombay for employment. This was my second trip to Bombay (24)  After coming to Bombay I had been staying with a distant relative in a chawl  in Family Lines.  We used to call his mother Aka.  I and three or four others from Daasgaon were staying at Aka’s place. They were all working somewhere or other and used to pay Aka for their food. It was four or five months since I had arrived and I had still not found a job. So I was not able to pay for my food. Nobody rebuked me, rather I was showered with affection. During this visit to Bombay I saw Dr. Ambedkar for the first time. Seeing Dr. Ambedkar made me acutely aware of the importance of getting an education. I had to leave school halfway because there was no one to support me (25) Most of the people living there earned their living doing some work connected with the army. (25) . Just then someone told me about a job; it was for just a month and a half, a leave vacancy, but the wages were forty-five rupees. But one needed to speak in English, to be able to read and write, and also to have good clothes. The person who had told me about the job had promised the sahib in that job that he would bring a man who would meet these terms.  One had to join service on the first. There were seven or eight days between. The main question was of the clothes; I had a dhoti and a coat. But this would not do among the European people; here one needed to have a coat and trousers. Finally I managed with the help of a butler. One the assigned day I was taken and stood before the sahib.  The sahib took me to an office and showed me some books of printed tickets that looked like receipts. He explained to me where to write the date and signature, and made me sit down near a table with a drawer for the receipt-books and money. On the outer side of the table there was a window. The white sailors would stand outside the window, pay their money and take the tickets. All the persons receiving the tickets were white and they did not know Hindi or Marathi; likewise my English was not good, but still our work was not held up. When they came up to the window and said, ‘one bed ticket’ or ‘four bar tickets’, I would take the money and give them what they asked for and the job was done.  To sum up, without much education and without any guarantee for the money, I got work as a seamen’s cashier. (25-6) . This extra money is not earned through toil, it is unholy money, it is a sin to keep it with you.  So you must spend it. All these friends smoked beedis, ate paan with tobacco, drank spirits and toddy and smoked pot and grass. They were the same ones who played one-string instruments, tambourines and drums and sang bhajans in the night. When we had finished eating something in the restaurant we would go and sit in a toddy bar in the Dhobi Talav or Crawford Market area. (26) She thought it a great thing that I brought my whole salary to her. I told her to take twenty rupees of it for my meals, five rupees to spend on herself, and to send the remaining twenty rupees to my home in Dasgaon.  She sent on the twenty rupees, but the people in the big house in Dasgaon did not give the money to my mother (27) I began to go to the docks to look for work. If one didn’t find work, one could go near the ships and try and find something to eat. One could get dates, all kinds of dried fruits, sugar to eat on the ships. One could also get a full meal for two pice. Sometimes one could get work as a labourer on daily wages. If one stood in the queue for work, even if one wasn’t selected as a labourer, one got one anna for attending the muster-call. It was to the Alexandra Docks that I went most often (28) By standing in line, doing the work of  ‘stamping’ when I got it, or doing coolie work for daily wages at the railway station, I could cover my expenses and pay for my board. Later I got work as a ‘marker’  in the Arsenal depot at Haji Bandar (dock). I had obtained this job for a salary of thirty rupees a month after months of being unemployed. (28) But when I started going to work at Haji Bandar I became familiar with some new areas of Bombay. The main among these were Grant Road and Foras Road. Later on I began to go to these areas Moré  and Moré  often. This was because three of my new-found companions were taking part in the Kamleshwar Drama Company that had just been started. (28) The Batatyachi Chawl where our theatre room was located was in the Safed Galli (literally, white lane). This Safed Galli was a big centre of the prostitution business. All the chawls in that area were buzzing with prostitutes. Prostitutes lived in some of the rooms in Batatyachi Chawl and tamasha players and other people lived  in the remaining rooms. (29) my friends kept a distance from bad things. This was because they were educated and cultured. Their attraction to the art of the theatre can be said to be a sign of their being cultured.  This was their way of trying to rise from a lower class to a higher class. After the rehearsals of the play Manovijay, it was first staged in the Bombay Theatre. I was of course proud to have worked as an actor on the stage of such a famous theatre in Bombay at such a young age (30) The money that I sent home when I was working in the Sailors’Home never reached my mother. This was repeated when I worked at Haji Bandar.  I always felt that the environment in Bombay was not conducive to study, that I would be able to go on studying if I went to Puné. My mothers’ relatives found it very strange that the people from the big house pocketed my money instead of giving it to my mother. But others would say, the people at the big house educated the boy, so why should they not take the money? (30) There was about twenty rupees in my pocket. It was about midnight.  I went to Bori Bandar station and got on the train to Puné without buying a ticket, and got down in Puné before sunrise (31)</p>

        <p>QUOTES: Since Modi Khana was a colony of army pensioners and since the name Abitkar was well known there, I had no difficulty in finding their house. The woman’s name was Kaali (Blackie). She was of fair complexion, pleasant and naive. But since her name was Kaali we used to call her Kaalibai. (31) I was afraid that, if I told them I had come to Puné to study, these people would inform Dasgaon and my schoolteacher relatives would come and take me back to Bombay. So I didn’t tell them anything about that. I had decided in my mind to stay with them as a guest for a few days, and then slip away from there. So while I was staying with them I tried to get to know Moré  about Puné. But they did not know anything beyond army –related places;  their knowledge was limited to the cantonment area of Puné.  They told me some stories they had heard about the days of Peshwa rule. They said, “We have nothing to do with Poona city. We hardly ever go there.” Even the children of the Modi Khana area did not go to school with children from the city. There were separate schools for these children in the vicinity. Just as in Bombay I had lived in the Family Lines meant for army people, so did I find myself among military people in Modi Khana.  In the villages there were separate areas for our folk. I felt that even in Bombay and Puné there were separate colonies for us, but I did not at the time understand who had separated us in this way. (32) The train left the station and halted for some time at Khadki station. (32) One day, a man in the canteen introduced me to a friend of his who worked in the Khadki arsenal.  He pointed out to me who the main boss in the arsenal was, and informed me about how I could get to meet him.  Accordingly I  came and stood at the gate of the arsenal at the time when the sahib was due to come there.  When the sahib approached I said, “Sir, I know English, I want work”. He said, “Come on.” I walked on behind him. When we entered the gate he entrusted me to a sergeant and went off. The sergeant began to show his disapproval by raising his eyebrows at me. Then he said something. But because of my limited English and his incomprehensible accent I didn’t understand what he said. Then he asked me my name. That much English I understood. I told him my name, which he wrote down, and then took me with him to a depot. There in a waterlogged place there were piles of wooden boxes filled with glassware.  About twenty convicts from the Yerawada jail were standing there. The sergeant told me to instruct the prisoners to carry those boxes to a dry place at some distance.  I made out what he was saying only from from his expression and gestures, and explained what he was saying to the prisoners’ warder in bazaar Hindi.  With that the work of moving the chests began. The sergeant was pleased to see this and he praised me. (33-4) I went to live in a chawl next to the Khadki bazaar. A gentleman from the Konkan who had retired from the khechar (mule) section of the army was living in a rented room there with his wife from Puné. They had no children and they knew nothing about their native gaon or village. I made their acquaintance and found out all I could learn about them. After I left the Modi Khana I took utmost care about one thing: to find out whatever I could about others, but never to reveal the true facts about myself. I behaved in this same manner with this couple. Then, seeing that I was educated, had a job and had nowhere to stay, they asked me to come and stay with them and I began to live in that chawl. After I got the job in the Arsenal I found a kind of stability. (34) The difference between a coolie and a clerk was only in the hardness of their labour. A clerk did not have to put in as much bodily exertion as a coolie did. In fact both the jobs needed no intellect!  The type of work I did went on changing quickly, but there was not much change in my life beyond work. The kind of environment which I inhabited since I left Kaalibai’s house in Modi Khana was one of joginis and muralis dedicated to the gods, the licentious behaviour of the white soldiers and their friends, and the pitiable condition of the poor who worked in occupations related to the army. I felt suffocated living in these surroundings. But one thing was clear: I was aware that I was living in a foul kind of environment. And so I was always making efforts to get out of it. When a man living on his own is aware of the sin he is committing, he feels remorse when he is punished and makes efforts to come away from it. But if he is not aware, he feels no remorse even after he suffers punishment, and makes no efforts to turn away from that deed. When I left the unhealthy environment of Dapodi  and went to live in Khadki, my life had turned in an appropriate direction. Soon after I came to Khadki, I had to have a small surgical operation on my right leg. My Indian soldier friends arranged for me to get admitted to the Khadki Military Hospital to get this done. The operation on my leg was done in that hospital and my ailment  was removed. I worked for two months after this operation. Then I learned about a night school that had been opened recently. This night school had been started by the Alegaonkar brothers who were followers of Lokmanya Tilak.  Its name was ‘Alegaonkars’ Night School’. As soon as I heard about this night school, I went there and registered my name.  Since I was in a job I had no difficulty in paying the fees and meeting the expense of buying books. My admission to night school was like a new life for me. It was a great joy for me that I had become a student again. (35-6) From the time I began to go to night school, I avoided spending too much time with my friends who were fond of tamashas, plays, cards, and gambling. Gradually I became detached from all these things. (36) In the Alegaonkars’ school my name had been entered for the fourth form. From there I entered the fifth form (38)  Just then news of an important event reached me: the death of Lokmanya Tilak.  To learn Moré  about this I went to Alegaonkars’ school with a few friends. There we were informed that a special train had been arranged for those who wanted to take part in Lokmanya Tilak’s funeral procession. (39)</p>

        <h3>SECTION 9 - BACK TO BOMBAY TO BACK TO MAHAD</h3>
        <p>QUOTES: Arriving in Bombay I was able to witness the unprecedented event of Tilak’s funeral procession. But I could still not put an end to the troubled and uncertain pattern of my life. Sardargruha, the place from which the procession set off, was just a small distance from the Family Lines where I had been staying before I left Bombay (39) After that, I walked as far as Bori Bandar and sat down in the Bhatia Gardens near there around one-thirty. In the gardens some people were sleeping, some were sitting on benches and some were walking around here and there. I decided to spend the night sitting there rather than waking my relatives at that time of night. (39) Since I was not new to Bombay I was still confident that I would find a way out of this.  So, without thinking too much about what had happened, I took the road to the docks. I went to an illiterate supervisor and agreed to write down  the names of the dockhands for him for any wages he was willing to give me. (40) But I had to be careful that I had enough money left over for breakfast in the morning. Sometimes I could not get work for as long as four days. At such times I would barely eat something with the help of my friends at work. My friends too were like me.  We helped each other as friends and accomplices. (40) Then I went to visit one of my relatives who lived in the Cement Chawl in Parel. He was happy to see me after such a long time. At night, after dinner I went to bed there. In the morning I had my first hot-water bath in days, had breakfast and then went upstairs to try and meet Ambedkar  Saheb (41)</p>

        <h3>SECTION 10 - BACK TO MAHAD</h3>
        <p>QUOTES: My mother felt as though I had been reborn (41) My homecoming this time became the subject of talk in every house, because it was well-known that persons from that village community from several generations who had vanished like me, never came back again. How was it that I had returned?  From this it appears that many persons of our community, not just from our villages but from other villages, often left their village and vanished. Could it be that this migration was an attempt at an individual escape from untouchability ? When I returned to Dasgaon I found that my home had become a school. Our house had been rented out to a Mahaar school and my mother was living in a small shed next to the big house and living on the wages of her labour. One of my father’s maternal cousins was the teacher in that school and he did not even give the rent to my mother. (42) Because I was caught in the deceitful net of false affection that the people at the big house cast over me, and I still did not have the courage to break out of it. I behaved just as those people asked me to behave. They, rather than my mother, exerted their authority over me. I had to hand over my salary to them. However, I did not give the rent money to them but to my mother. They made a noise about this at first, but I did not listen to them.  So I began to hand over three rupees a month as rent and two rupees for sweeping and cleaning the rooms daily, to my mother. Besides this, I spared whatever money I could out of my pay, for basic needs, to give my mother. In those days one could buy a mann measure of rice for a rupee and other things were also cheap. So my mother got some relief. Now, whether I went on working as a teacher or not, five rupees a month would come into my mother’s hands.  My return to Dasgaon secured this much for my mother. (42) I had not gone to Bombay and Puné with the intention of making money. My objective was education.  I felt bad because my education was incomplete. (42) . I was being offered the job even though I didn’t have the necessary educational qualifications.  That was because I had relatives in the Mahaar regiment, and this  Conservator had been connected to the Mahaar and other army regiments. So this was a rare opportunity for me.  But when the people in the big house and our neighbours sat down together at night to think about this offer, except for me and one or two other persons everyone was of the opinion that I should not take this job. What they said was that this was the Forest Office after all. Nobody could tell when I might be murdered there. Others will not like it (that I had such an important post). They will conspire to bring you down in any way they can and later will say they had nothing to do with it. Even though we are under British rule, our people are not taken into government service anywhere except in the army. Even an ordinary policeman’s job is not given to our people. Even guards in the Forest Office are usually not from among our people. In view of all this, I should not take this job.--- this was  everybody’s opinion.  Some said, “Even if it is a golden dagger, should one pierce it in one’s own heart?” On one side there was this resistance from my family, and on the other my fervent desire to study further, and so I let a good opportunity pass. If I had accepted this job offer, I would have been much talked about as the first untouchable in the Bombay Presidency to be a candidate for a post as high as a Ranger in  a civil service job in the government. (43-4)  When my term as a teacher in the leave vacancy was over, I changed from being a teacher to a student. My name was entered in the school at Mahaad once again  in the fifth English class. (44) . After I was admitted to the school in Mahaad for the first time, a tea-shop had been started in the marketplace to solve the problem I, and my brethren coming from the villages, faced in getting drinking water. That restaurant was still running when I returned. It used to be closed during the rains and open in the hot seasons; but because it was far from the untouchable colony nobody stayed there at night.  But now there were more customers visiting the teashop.  There had been a  very large inflow of ex-soldiers in that vicinity.  This was due to the disbanding   and breaking up of the 111th Mahaar regiment  after the war was over. These unemployed soldiers were now earning their subsistence through farming or through manual labour. Because of their military occupation and their having travelled widely, they were bold and courageous. (46) . That tea-shop had become a virtual information centre for  a circle of about sixty  square miles around Mahaad.  Raigad, Pratapgad and the villages of the valley come within that circle. (46) At one point a landlord named Deshmukh closed down that tea-shop owned by Mohoprekar, as part of an action taken against Mohoprekar, who was his tenant. But I defeated the landlord’s action: I took over the teashop myself,  put up a board saying “R.B. Moré’s Rest House”, and then got it going again (48) .  One day after the bill had been passed, I organised a small meeting  in the Mahaar colony with  some military pensioners visiting the marketplace and some of my friends, where I told them about this bill which had been passed by the government. Besides me, there was another outspoken person present, an elderly man  named Maruti Agavane. (49) In that meeting we made a decision of historical importance: to hold a conference of the Colaba District Outcaste Association in Mahaad under the chairmanship of Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar. The heads of caste panchayats were entrusted with the responsibility of collecting three rupees a head from each and every village, to cover the expenses of holding the conference. Now a new air of enthusiasm sprang up among the untouchable youth in the marketplace. Everywhere there was talk about the prospect of Ambedkar Saheb coming to Mahaad for a big gathering. (49)</p>

        <h3>SECTION 11 - DASMODAR HALL / CONFERENCE</h3>
        <p>QUOTES: Later, in 1924, in the month of May, I went to Bombay and met Ambedkar Saheb.  The people of the Social Service League had given him a room on the first floor above the Damodar restaurant in Parel (50) He (Ambedkar) inquired about where I lived, what I did, how far I had studied and so on, and expressed his satisfaction. He then said to me, “You don’t know what people of the Konkan are like. They are very obstinate. They will always say, what we do is as it should be. They will say, who is this Christ-lover coming here telling us what to do? And they won’t listen to me.”  To  which I answered, “Saheb, they listen to me so they will certainly listen to you.” In the end he said, “I have no time just now. Come back during the Diwali vacations and we will see what we can do.” Then I went back to Chitré who was in the next room. He asked me how I intended to collect money for the conference, and I told him that the people from villages all over would raise a little money. He then promised to help us in the financing and so we chalked out a plan.  The plan was to put up a play and use the income from that for the conference (50) We had secured a free performance of this play solely on the word of Chitré and Kadam. But who was to carry out the responsibility of selling the tickets? The play was to be performed in the Damodar Hall, and this hall was owned by the Social Service League. So we were to get the hall also for free. We only had to arrange for the sale of tickets. I felt that Balaram Ambedkar (Bhimrao’s elder brother) could help us out in this, and so I went to see him and asked for his help. He too was very happy to learn that a conference was to be held in Mahaad. He promised that he would come to Mahaad for the conference, but he did not undertake the responsibility of selling tickets. (51) . When he heard that I had received my Marathi and English education in the villages and when he heard about our plans for the conference, he was overcome with emotion.  But when it came to the question of selling tickets, he flatly refused to sell the tickets himself or to get someone else to sell them, pointing to the people’s bad habits and addictions.  Balaram Ambedkar and Sambhaji Gaikwad were at the time the only two people I knew in the whole of Bombay who had a concern for social activity, excepting Dr. Ambedkar himself. Since both of them had turned me down, I was very disappointed. Then I went to meet three friends of mine who lived in the servants’ quarters of St. George Hospital in the Fort area. I told them about all this business of selling tickets for the  play. All three of them were working as uniformed guards or peons. Two of them were barely literate and the third had passed the fourth standard examination in  Marathi school. With the help of these friends I managed to sell some four-anna tickets  and about twenty eight-anna and ten-anna tickets. And on the actual day of the performance these three came with me to the Damodar Hall to see to the other arrangements. I seated the one who was most educated at the ticket window to sell tickets, and gave the job of checking the tickets of people entering the theatre to the other two. Since the hall had four or five entrances, these two were not able to do their job properly. (51) After a while the curtain was raised and I stood up. There was a clamour of applause. I placed my hands on the table to steady myself and gave thanks in a few words speaking slowly, as if I was giving dictation to a class of schoolchildren.  This was the first speech I had made before an audience of the educated of Bombay, on the dais of a public hall. (51)</p>
