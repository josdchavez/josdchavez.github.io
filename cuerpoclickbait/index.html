<p>The reading experience that follows is disruptive and it is meant to be that way. The disruption is an invitation to read the aesthetics of the site as part of the argument itself. Embrace disruption: wait for the color to fade or maybe highlight the text with your cursor. Copy paste the words or download it as a pdf if you must. What the disruption invites is a form of interaction, a different kind of relation to the knowledge presented, a demand that perhaps you just wait and ponder upon what you read until it becomes readable again. I will offer no roadmap of my argument either. If I'm setting out to create a disruptive experience why would I make it so easy as to give you the ready-made argument. The argument is part of the experience of the site itself. It is my hope that by the end of the piece, this disruptive experience might be appreciated differently</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Another Unresolved Murder</i></div>
<br>
<p>
Susana Chavez was strangled in her hometown of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, most likely on January 6th 2011. She was a poet engaged in local activism, trying to end the femicides that had been taking place with no accountability since 1993. When she died, the general attorney of Chihuahua denied her death had anything to do with her activism and tried to shift the blame on her, stating she had met up with some “men.” What he really meant was: “she was a bad woman who doesn’t deserve so much public concern since she was asking for it by doing drugs, drinking alcohol and having sex with the men late at night.” However, a quick glance at her poetry, all self-published on her blog, immediately puts pressure on the general attorney’s statement - her gay identity is a motif across her work, and so is the gratuitous, gendered violence that took away her life. She had anticipated her murderer years ago.</p>
<p>In her poem "Cuerpo Desierto," the narrator starts by recounting how “algunos” (some) carry her “cuerpo desierto” (deserted body) on their back. The image is an oxymoron - if it is deserted, if there is nothing, why carry it, why continue this poem? The tension in the contradiction suggests the narrator’s deserted body has value in its condition, otherwise, why carry it? The image has in its non-consensual violence the ability to be a metaphor for the process of accumulation by dispossession and appropriation that perpetuates capitalism. Such metaphor is sustained by the medium through which the reader interacts with the poem - Chavez’s blog, a corpus of digital work that traces the absence of her physical presence and is simultaneously obscured by the capitalist demand to produce surplus value. The surplus value, i.e. the moment in which capitalism attempts to appropriate Chavez’s blog for profit, is the moment when the user clicks, when one tries to read her poems and instead gets...an ad.</p>
<p>It is her blog that this mixed media project will remix. Through this piece, my intention is to suggest that Chavez’s valuable (to capitalism) disposability as a woman who can be murdered with impunity extends to what’s left of her: the self-published blog that contains her poetry, photography and journal writing. Her website is also not exempt from a “life” of valuable spam. By weaving together screen-recordings of me surfing her blog, Chavez’s “Cuerpo Desierto” poem and quotes from Melissa Wright’s Disposable Women and Other Myths of Global Capitalism, I position her blog as an anti-dystopian aesthetic object where its own disrepair becomes an indictment of the femicides in Ciudad Juarez. Chavez’s unresolved murder haunts in between clicks, calling attention to the ways in which capitalism and the violence it requires for its perpetuation extends to new technologies like the Internet, as another “resource” that can be used for “profit.” To look for Chavez’s presence in her blog is to allow oneself to be haunted, to let this ghost enunciate the ways in which we, through our drive to achieve pleasure, are imbricated in the perpetuation of the possibility of gratuitous gendered violence to continue in Ciudad Juarez.</p>

Here is a cursory glance of the blog: <br>

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Blogging Pleasure, Clicking Money</i></div>
<p><i>“Like myths told over the centuries, the myth of the disposable third world woman attempts to provide steadfast lessons about what is accepted as “truth,” “factual reality,” and deep-seated “human essence” all packaged within a synthetic narrative, laden with symbolism and drama.” </i>(Wright, 3).</p>
<p>In order to understand the haunting potential of Chavez’s blog as anti-dystopic, we must think about the relationship between blogging and pleasure. The subject who engages in writing and publishing a blog for an audience of strangers is one that must derive pleasure from this practice, as it is this pleasure that compels the subject to keep going since it is done during a time of leisure. Departing from this logic, political philosopher and feminist theorist Jodi Dean argues that, regardless of content, blogging and the pleasure experienced by the blogger is appropriated in the current regime of communicative capitalism, a category that Dean uses to denote a form of late capitalism in which communication itself is exchanged like a commodity. The particular subjectivity that derives enjoyment from the exchange of language for the exchange itself Dean describes as “whatever being,” “an enactment of existence without qualities, or at least qualities so interchangeable and obvious that they erase all identity.” An identity-less existence emphasizes flexibility, to have not one way of creating meaning but multiple icons that a subject can emulate, for however long, as a blueprint for meaning-making in their own life. It is through blogging that the blogger can shape themselves after whatever icon of meaning-making is appealing at the moment. The flexibility to create meaning and the pleasure derived from such is what communicative capitalism accumulates, turning it into a commodity, language that cannot access meaning...

<p><i>The moment of appropriation: when Chavez’s posts about the things she did on a Sunday afternoon become repositories for spam, for pop ups with broken links, for clicking for the sake of clicking, traffic for the sake of traffic:

<div style="text-align: center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DvNoj0pbPKQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>
  How exactly is the flexibility of the whatever-being involved in the circulation of pleasure? For the whatever-being to remain flexible and to keep shifting, the pleasure that is presumably obtained must be insufficient. Otherwise, the subject would not feel compelled to continue. However, Dean points out that the networks where pleasure (and icons for meaning-making) circulates not only prolong the achievement of the subject’s enjoyment (it is insufficient) but also the prolongation of enjoyment is in itself enjoyable as it allows the whatever-being to continue exchanging messages for the sake of the exchange: “The expropriation of language in the spectacle opens up a new experience of language and linguistic being: not this or that content of language, but language itself, not this or that true proposition, but the very fact that one speaks. Failure to communicate provides its own satisfaction, the enjoyment of language itself.” The pop-up ads that get in the way of reading the actual content becomes the content itself, they displace what the writing meant to Chavez and what it could possibly mean to an audience. Instead we simply enjoy “browsing,” the pleasure of possibly reading but probably just going to a different site. In the meantime, each click leads to a new ad, a new traffic metric for advertisers and marketers. 
 Failure to communicate provides its own satisfaction, the enjoyment of language itself.” Blogging is therefore a moment of “expropriation of language,” one where capitalism accumulates language, dispossessing the words from their meaning, in order to gain wealth from the worker’s (the creator of the blog) leisure time. As it is an expropriation of value from a commodity produced during the subject’s own free time, blogging can thus be seen as a double dispossession of language and leisure.</p>

<p>Dean’s insights allows us to see the dynamics of capitalist appropriation. In a way, the current state of disrepair of Chavez’s blog is eerily reminiscent to what she describes in “Cuerpo Desierto.” The two sites have a shared aesthetics of valuable waste. Not only is the meaning of what she wrote on her blog expropriated, but in doing so, it echoes the expropriation of her own body, her own life. Just how the body of “Cuerpo Desierto’s” narrator is carried around despite the declared hollowness and thus hinting at its value as is, Chavez’s blog remains despite lack of new content, despite its author’s murder since it is a valuable place to redirect for ads, to generate clicks for the sake of clicks. If this content is also "disposable," valuable insofar as it is broken, what happens if we freeze it out, and read it, read her everyday stories, her complaints, her frustrations, her desires? Go ahead and read some of it:

“The wasting of the Mexican woman, therefore, represents a value in and of itself to capital in at least two respects. First, she establishes the standard for recognizing the production of value in people and in things: value appreciates in what she is not. Second, she incorporates flexibility into the labor supply through her turnover” (Wright, 74).</i></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><i>Suchaca, the Anti-Dystopic Enunciation</i></div>
<p>If Chavez’s blog in disrepair can be understood in relation to Wright’s notion of the myth of disposability that surrounds Juarez maquiladora workers and attempts to define them as valuable waste-in-the-making, it is done through a leap of imagination. What if we choose to reimagine this blog as “dystopic,” a mirror to bring into frames of legibility the real life dystopia of violence in Juarez? In other words, seeing the blog as anti-dystopic allows us to see and recognize the gratuitous gendered violence in Juarez as  gratuitous gendered violence, not the result of Mexican culture or individual behavior. The experience of navigating Chavez’s blog, i.e. the sensations of coursing through it, points towards a dystopia that fits Jessica Langer’s description in her book Shapes of Dystopia: “Rather than imagining a world in which the criticized aspects of the author’s society have disappeared, it instead imagines a world in which those same aspects are overgrown and run amok, displacing them into an alternate universe where life is defined by them.” Both “overgrown” and “run amok” convey an image of wilderness, of lack of control. That is precisely what happens when one navigates Chavez’s blog. The sovereignty the mouse normally exerts over the content on the screen is denied in favor of spam. One does not know what will happen with the next click and in order to actually reach the desired content, one must “pluck” the “overgrown” that, in the website’s state of disrepair, has “run amok” and taken over the screen.</p>
<p><i>“Their usefulness derives largely from their claims to unquestionable authority, which Roland Barthes (1972) captured with his statement that myths are “depoliticized speech.” Myths, to use his words, “empty [reality] of history” by cloaking political situations with narratives of human essence and naturalized tautologies.” (Wright, 3)</i>

<p>Some might be questioning the validity of this re-imagining, and to them I say that this embrace of the dystopic is a productive undertaking because the blog in disrepair can holistically be understood as an aesthetic object, or “art.” One of the many theoretical frameworks that facilitates this “appropriation” is a decolonial engagement elaborated by Argentine semiotician Walter Mignolo. Mignolo opens up the words “art” and “aesthetics” from their narrow understanding through a tracing of their etymology: “Art (from the Latin ars), which means simply to make, derived from poiesis, which in Greek also meant to make” (200). With Kant, “art” (which meant “to make”) gets stitched together with “aesthetics,” which comes from the Greek “aesthesis,” referring “to the senses and the emotions derived from senses” (200), resulting into the contemporary understanding of Art. A decolonial engagement attempts to delink this inherited understanding of aesthetics from “aestheSis,” which simply means to sense. Engaging decolonially with the blog’s aestheSis is similar to how Heidegger understood aesthetics, not as art but simply as the “ontological condition of being enmeshed in things,” the “entire domain of subjective, everyday experience.” Therefore, the blog-as-is is an aesthetic object in itself, regardless of intent. It offers another narrative, a different “myth” that tries to make sense of the world without “cloaking politics” and getting rid of history since Mignolo’s decolonial aesthetics works within both, pointing us back to the presence of colonialism and imperialism in the creation of modern “Mexico” and the current transnational economic, financial system. </p>

<p>If a decolonial approach can help us create a myth that foregrounds politics and history in trying to make sense of what happened to Chavez, a myth that offers an alternative to understand the gratuitous violence that is justified by the myth of the disposable third world woman, what exactly can we say from here? In imagining Chavez's blog as a “dystopic aesthetic object,” I can read the blog as a moment of enunciation. What do I mean by the blog as “ a moment of enunciation?” Mignolo remarks: “There is not a world that is represented, but a world that is constantly invented in the enunciation” (198). From the blog, one can “enunciate” the world in a way that encourages “thinking and doing that is geared toward undoing a particular kind of aesthesis, of senses, that is the sensibility of the colonized subject” (201).  This sensibility, Mignolo describes as sociogenesis, the colonial wound where “I am who I am because of the gaze of the other and that other is a White other” (201). Enunciating the sociogenesis through aestheSis (through the senses and its emotions) therefore becomes the moment where the entanglement of the power differential between the “racialized I” and the “White other” allows a healing of both subjects that is not aimed towards re-incorporation into an imperative to work or to “get better.” Instead, its a healing that has as its main concern to teach how “to be” (207). In the case of this piece, the word “teaching” refers to the subjective experience of experiencing the blog as it enunciates a world where the power differential has “run amok.” Reading the blog as dystopic is therefore an act of decoloniality, where one can counteract the sociogenesis where the other (the people who are racialized and gendered into valuable waste) and the I (the sovereign, whatever being controlling the mouse, with an access to jouissance that Chavez did not have) come to see disposability as the condition of possibility for both of their existence. It is after such recognition that "letting be" may begin, turning this...

<p>By paying attention to how the blog enunciates in its overgrown advertisement a world where meaning is quite literally displaced for the sake of a click, Chavez’s blog becomes a moment of anti-dystopic imagination. Langer understands anti-dystopic as “both within and outside the utopia/dystopia construct, a space of internal contradiction” (186) where the contradiction is brought to the “fore.” Chavez’s blog is anti-dystopic because it brings attention to two contradictions: 1) a blog that was meant for leisure and self-expression is violently and suddenly turned into waste/junk/spam but still remains accessible as a repository for ads, for sites that potentially extract surplus-value. This contradiction brings to the “fore” the second contradiction: in Ciudad Juarez, as Wright’s notion of the myth of the disposable third world woman and Chavez’s own poetry suggest, migrant women-workers are valuable waste-in-the-making, subjects who must remain “disposable” in order for multinational corporations to extract recognizable value (money) from their bodies. Furthermore, clicking the links can serve as metaphor, bringing attention to our own participation in the enunciation of a world where women like Chavez and migrant maquiladora workers can be the aim of gratuitous violence. Femicide is dystopic and the online conditions of the blog are thus a productive site where it can be denounced through a nightmarish hyperbole, through a leap of imagination that does not lead us to pleasure but rather asks us to linger, to watch out for the haunting…</pr>

<p> Rather than seeking out the pleasure of reading another blog, moving to a different site that works properly, perhaps it is necessary to work around the ads, to keep opening tabs and to read, to find ourselves in the discomfort of reading the words of someone who was killed for challenging the regime of disposability through her being-in-the-world.</p>

<p> From the blog, from the weaving of it into this site that has been purposely coded to avoid a traditional, “easy, smooth, and pleasurable” experience of reading, one can enunciate into being a reality of disposability that is often cloaked by international discourse as a result of the "violence of an inferior culture.” The femicides in Juarez are not a result of Mexican culture as they are the result of gratuitous violence necessary for the continuation of late capitalism. The blog is another site where disposability manifests, a place where waste/junk Is valuable because it is the condition of possibility for the “other” to experience jouissance, to consume content, to establish meaning at the expense of a subject who was forced to contest with the paradox of turning
