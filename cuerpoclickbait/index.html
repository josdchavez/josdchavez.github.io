title: cuerpoclickbait: a speculative, anti-dystopian digital collage
---
Susana Chavez was a student/activist/poet who coined the phrase "Ni Una Mas" ("Not one more"), a motto widely used by human rights campaigns and organizations to condemn not only the femicides in Ciudad Juarez but also the indifference of the authorities. Chavez was among the victims of this dystopia where one can die for "being a woman." She explicitly explored this condition through her poetry: In "Cuerpo Desierto," the narrator recounts how “algunos” (some) carry her “cuerpo desierto” (deserted body) on their back, hinting at the tension between being in her body but not being able to own it. This tension reveals that the deserted body has value as is, otherwise, those who are carrying it would instead forget about it. The expropriation of her body's value for the sake of others is not, however, limited to a physical body. When Chavez died, she also left a corpus of digital work in the shape of her personal blog, her physical body turned into a digital body that remains despite her death.
