CUERPO CLICKBAIT: A SPECULATIVE, ANTI-DYSTOPIC DIGITAL COLLAGE </p>
<p>
Susana Chavez was a student/activist/poet who coined the phrase "Ni Una Mas" ("Not one more"), a motto widely used by human rights campaigns and organizations to condemn not only the femicides in Ciudad Juarez but also the 
indifference of the authorities. Chavez was among the victims of this dystopia where one can die for "being a woman." 
She explicitly explored this condition through her poetry: In "Cuerpo Desierto," the narrator recounts how “algunos” 
(some) carry her “cuerpo desierto” (deserted body) on their back, hinting at the tension between being in her body but not being able to own it. 
This tension reveals that the deserted body has value as is, otherwise, 
those who are carrying it would instead forget about it. The expropriation of her body's value for the sake of others is not, 
however, limited to a physical body. When Chavez died, she also left a corpus of digital work in the shape of her personal blog, 
her physical body turned into a digital body that remains despite her death.</p>
<p>
This essay explores the continuum between online and offline life in Ciudad Juarez where certain subjects are not only rendered disposable but their cultural productions as well become valuable waste. In other words, this mixed media piece explores how the logic of disposability that discursively defines women in Ciudad Juarez exists also in the online world – specifically in Susana Chavez’s blog. Through the screen-recordings of me surfing her blog, quotes from Chavez’s poetry and from Wright’s Disposable Women and Other Myths of Global Capitalism, I position her blog as an anti-dystopian aesthetic object where its own disrepair becomes an indictment of the femicides in Ciudad Juarez. Chavez’s own unresolved murder haunts in between clicks, calling attention to the ways in which capitalism comes together with everyday technologies of leisure like the Internet in order to reproduce itself, taking advantage of the circulation of drive and jouissance. It is this haunting that has the potential for anti-dystopia, to enunciate our role in the production of the dystopia and to demand from us the need for radical reimagining.
  Here is a cursory glance of the blog:</p>

<p><i>“Like myths told over the centuries, the myth of the disposable third world woman attempts to provide steadfast lessons about what is accepted as “truth,” “factual reality,” and deep-seated “human essence” all packaged within a synthetic narrative, laden with symbolism and drama.” </i>(Wright, 3).</p>
<p>Writing and publishing an online blog for the consumption of other people (normally strangers) need a specific kind of subjectivity that derives pleasure from this practice, as it is this pleasure that compels the subject to keep blogging. Given this circulation of pleasure (or jouissance), Jodi Dean argues that, regardless of content, blogging contributes directly to communicative capitalism, a category that denotes a form of late capitalism in which communication itself is exchanged like a commodity, done so by an act of reflexivity that captures creativity and resistance (the possible content of the blog) for the profit and enjoyment of others. Dean names the particular subjectivity that derives enjoyment from such communicative exchange a “whatever-being,” “an enactment of existence without qualities, or at least qualities so interchangeable and obvious that they erase all identity” (66). An identity-less existence refers not so much to a position of being “lost” or “confused” but rather to the ability to be flexible, to have not one way of creating meaning but multiple icons that a subject can emulate, for however long, as a blueprint for meaning-making in their own life. It is through blogging that the blogger can shape themselves after whatever icon of meaning-making is appealing at the moment. The act of documenting such flexibility is what communicative capitalism accumulates, turning it into a commodity, a deserted body...

<p><i>content about the concert Chavez is excited about and posts about the things she did on a particular afternoon become repositories for spam, for pop ups with broken links, for clicking for the sake of clicking, traffic for the sake of traffic:</i></p>

  However, for the whatever-being to remain flexible and to keep sharing and shifting, the pleasure that is presumably obtained must be insufficient. Otherwise, the subject would not feel compelled to continue. Dean argues that the networks where pleasure (and icons for meaning-making) circulates not only prolong the achievement of the subject’s enjoyment but also the prolongation of enjoyment is in itself enjoyable as it allows the whatever-being to continue exchanging messages for the sake of the exchange. In such state, “The expropriation of language in the spectacle opens up a new experience of language and linguistic being: not this or that content of language, but language itself, not this or that true proposition, but the very fact that one speaks. Failure to communicate provides its own satisfaction, the enjoyment of language itself.” Blogging is therefore a moment of “expropriation of language,” one where capitalism accumulates language, dispossessing the words from their meaning, in order to gain wealth from the worker’s (the creator of the blog) leisure time. As it is an expropriation of value from a commodity produced during the subject’s own free time, blogging can thus be seen as a double dispossession of language and leisure.</p>

<p>Given Dean’s theorization, the Susana Chavez blog can be understood as directly contributing to communicative capitalism. However, how is it that Chavez’s blog is doing this? Thinking through it demands we consider the way in which the logic of valuable waste also surrounds online cultural production. Given that she lived in Ciudad Juarez and was murdered in her own city (still unresolved), the blog gains an ominous quality – not only is her language expropriated, but it also records the expropriation of her physical body, how she was robbed of her own life. Her death points out to the discursive reality of disposability that defines everyday life for women in Ciudad Juarez, a reality explored by Melissa Wright through her myth of the disposable third world woman but also explored by Chavez in her own poetry – the feeling of the body turning into waste, a waste that is nonetheless valuable insofar as it remains disposable. In other words, Chavez lived through a dystopic world where femicide is the norm.
Chavez’s blog exists in a state of disrepair. Most of the links don’t work: when one clicks them instead of linking to the post intended by Chavez, it opens a new tab with an ad. Almost anything one interacts leads to a different site. In other words, the blog is permeated with spam. It is junk that nonetheless is maintained and re-coded. It is through the notion of the blog as valuable waste that capitalism in Ciudad Juarez expropriates “life” in a continuum of offline to online in order to maintain certain subjects and their aesthetic/cultural practices in a state of disposability, thus enabling its own reproduction and replicating (online) the dynamics of violence that render female workers in Juarez disposable.

“The wasting of the Mexican woman, therefore, represents a value in and of itself to capital in at least two respects. First, she establishes the standard for recognizing the production of value in people and in things: value appreciates in what she is not. Second, she incorporates flexibility into the labor supply through her turnover” (Wright, 74).</i></p>

<p>If Chavez’s blog in disrepair can be understood in relation to Wright’s notion of the myth of disposability that discursively defines Juarez maquiladora workers as valuable waste-in-the-making, it is done through a leap of imagination: what if we reimagine this blog as “dystopic,” just like her “real life” conditions of femicide? The experience of navigating Chavez’s blog, i.e. the aesthetics, the sensations of coursing through it, points towards a dystopia that: “Rather than imagining a world in which the criticized aspects of the author’s society have disappeared, it instead imagines a world in which those same aspects are overgrown and run amok, displacing them into an alternate universe where life is defined by them” (Langer, 171). Both “overgrown” and “run amok” convey an image of wilderness, of lack of control. That is precisely what happens when one navigates Chavez’s blog. The sovereignty the mouse normally exerts over the content on the screen is denied in favor of spam. One does not know what will happen with the next click and in order to actually reach the desired content, one must “pluck” the “overgrown” that, in the website’s state of disrepair, has “run amok” and taken over the screen.</p>
<p><i>“Their usefulness derives largely from their claims to unquestionable authority, which Roland Barthes (1972) captured with his statement that myths are “depoliticized speech.” Myths, to use his words, “empty [reality] of history” by cloaking political situations with narratives of human essence and naturalized tautologies.” (Wright, 3)

<p>Some might argue against this line of reasoning because the author did not intentionally make a dystopic work. Chavez did not intentionally add those hyperlinks that almost prevent access to the content. While this is true, I argue that the leap of the imagination into the dystopic is a valid and productive undertaking because the blog in disrepair can holistically be understood as an aesthetic object through a decolonial engagement elaborated by Walter Mignolo. Mignolo opens up the words “art” and “aesthetics” from their narrow understanding through a tracing of their etymology: “Art (from the Latin ars), which means simply to make, derived from poiesis, which in Greek meant to make” (200). With Kant, art=to make becomes coupled with aesthetics, which comes from the Greek aesthesis, referring “to the senses and the emotions derived from senses” (200), resulting into the contemporary understanding of aesthetics and arts. A decolonial engagement attempts to delink Kant’s legacy, to delink an elitist understanding of aesthetics from aestheSis, which simply means to sense. Engaging decolonially with the blog’s aestheSis is similar to how Heidegger understood aesthetics, not as art but simply as the “ontological condition of being enmeshed in things,” the “entire domain of subjective, everyday experience.” Therefore, the blog-as-is is an aesthetic object in itself, regardless of intent.</p>

<p>In imagining Chavez's blog as a “dystopic aesthetic object,” I am actively engaging with Mignolo’s decolonial option in order to read the blog as a point of enunciation. Mignolo remarks that decoloniality is not about representation but enunciation: “There is not a world that is represented, but a world that is constantly invented in the enunciation” (198). From the blog, one can “enunciate” the world decolonially. Mignolo explains that “decolonial aestheSis refers to any “thinking and doing that is geared toward undoing a particular kind of aesthesis, of senses, that is the sensibility of the colonized subject” (201).  This sensibility, Mignolo describes as sociogenesis, the colonial wound where “I am who I am because of the gaze of the other and that other is a White other” (201). Enunciating the sociogenesis through aestheSis (through the senses and its emotions) therefore becomes the moment where the entanglement of the power differential between the “racialized I” and the “White other” allows the healing of the subjects, a healing not aimed towards re-incorporation into an imperative to work but rather one that is done communally, teaching them “to be” (207). The word “teaching” therefore refers to the subjective experience of experiencing the blog as it enunciates a world where the power differential has “run amok.” Reading the blog as dystopic is therefore an act of decoloniality, where one can counteract the sociogenesis where the other (the people who are racialized and gendered into valuable waste) and the I (the sovereign, whatever being controlling the mouse, with an access to jouissance that Chavez did not have) come to see disposability as the condition of possibility for both of their existence. It is after such recognition that healing/"letting be" may begin</p>

<p>By paying attention to how the blog enunciates in its over-grown advertisement a world where meaning is quite literally displaced for the sake of a click, Chavez’s blog becomes a moment of anti-dystopic imagination. Langer understands anti-dystopic as “both within and outside the utopia/dystopia construct, a space of internal contradiction” (186) where the contradiction is brought to the “fore.” Chavez’s blog is anti-dystopic because it brings attention to two contradictions: 1) a blog that was meant for leisure, for self-expression is suddenly waste/junk/spam as it is no longer in use, but still becomes a repository for ads, for sites that potentially extract surplus-value. This contradiction brings to the “fore” the second contradiction (which also mirrors the logic of the first one): 2) in Ciudad Juarez, as Wright’s notion of the myth of the disposable third world woman and Chavez’s own poetry suggest, migrant women-workers are discursively defined as valuable waste-in-the-making, 
  as subjects who must necessarily remain “disposable” in order for multinational corporation to extract value and profit from their bodies. Furthermore, clicking the links brings attention to our own engagement with the dystopic: our own participation in the enunciation of a world where women like Chavez and migrant maquiladora workers can be murdered with no accountability or justice. Femicide is dystopic and the online conditions of the blog are thus a productive site where it can be denounced through a nightmarish hyperbole, through a leap of imagination that does not lead us to jouissance but rather discomfort, anxiety, maybe even guilt?</pr>

  The blog is a site where the already-disposable body of Chavez is re-appropriated. Rather than seeking out the pleasure of reading another blog, moving to a different site that works properly, perhaps it is necessary to work around the ads, to keep opening tabs and to read, to find ourselves in the discomfort of reading the words of someone who was killed for challenging the regime of disposability through her poetry and her being-in-the-world, both the irl world and url world.

It is from the blog that can be enunciated into being a reality of disposability that is often cloaked by international discourse as a result of the "violence of [an inferior] culture.” The femicides in Juarez are not a result of Mexican culture. The disrepair of Chavez’s blog is not the result of inferior technology. They are both manifestations of disposability, of waste/junk as valuable because it is the condition of possibility for the other to experience jouissance, to consume content, to establish meaning at the expense of a subject who was forced to contest with the paradox of turning
