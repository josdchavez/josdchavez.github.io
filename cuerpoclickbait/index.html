CUERPO CLICKBAIT: A SPECULATIVE, ANTI-DYSTOPIC DIGITAL COLLAGE </p>
<p>
Susana Chavez was a student/activist/poet who coined the phrase "Ni Una Mas" ("Not one more"), a motto widely used by human rights campaigns and organizations to condemn not only the femicides in Ciudad Juarez but also the 
indifference of the authorities. Chavez was among the victims of this dystopia where one can die for "being a woman." 
She explicitly explored this condition through her poetry: In "Cuerpo Desierto," the narrator recounts how “algunos” 
(some) carry her “cuerpo desierto” (deserted body) on their back, hinting at the tension between being in her body but not being able to own it. 
This tension reveals that the deserted body has value as is, otherwise, 
those who are carrying it would instead forget about it. The expropriation of her body's value for the sake of others is not, 
however, limited to a physical body. When Chavez died, she also left a corpus of digital work in the shape of her personal blog, 
her physical body turned into a digital body that remains despite her death.</p>

This essay explores the continuum between online and offline life in Ciudad Juarez where certain subjects are not only rendered disposable but their cultural productions as well become valuable waste. In other words, this mixed media piece explores how the logic of disposability that discursively defines women in Ciudad Juarez exists also in the online world – specifically in Susana Chavez’s blog. Through the screen-recordings of me surfing her blog, quotes from Chavez’s poetry and from Wright’s Disposable Women and Other Myths of Global Capitalism, I position her blog as an anti-dystopian aesthetic object where its own disrepair becomes an indictment of the femicides in Ciudad Juarez. Chavez’s own unresolved murder haunts in between clicks, calling attention to the ways in which capitalism comes together with everyday technologies of leisure like the Internet in order to reproduce itself, taking advantage of the circulation of drive and jouissance. It is this haunting that has the potential for anti-dystopia, to enunciate our role in the production of the dystopia and to demand from us the need for radical reimagining.
  Here is a cursory glance of the blog:</p>

<p><i>“Like myths told over the centuries, the myth of the disposable third world woman attempts to provide steadfast lessons about what is accepted as “truth,” “factual reality,” and deep-seated “human essence” all packaged within a synthetic narrative, laden with symbolism and drama.” </i>(Wright, 3).</p>
<p>Writing and publishing an online blog for the consumption of other people (normally strangers) need a specific kind of subjectivity that derives pleasure from this practice, as it is this pleasure that compels the subject to keep blogging. Given this circulation of pleasure (or jouissance), Jodi Dean argues that, regardless of content, blogging contributes directly to communicative capitalism, a category that denotes a form of late capitalism in which communication itself is exchanged like a commodity, done so by an act of reflexivity that captures creativity and resistance (the possible content of the blog) for the profit and enjoyment of others. Dean names the particular subjectivity that derives enjoyment from such communicative exchange a “whatever-being,” “an enactment of existence without qualities, or at least qualities so interchangeable and obvious that they erase all identity” (66). An identity-less existence refers not so much to a position of being “lost” or “confused” but rather to the ability to be flexible, to have not one way of creating meaning but multiple icons that a subject can emulate, for however long, as a blueprint for meaning-making in their own life. It is through blogging that the blogger can shape themselves after whatever icon of meaning-making is appealing at the moment. The act of documenting such flexibility is what communicative capitalism accumulates, turning it into a commodity, a deserted body...

Some carry my deserted body
behind their back
as if a path were  
a day crossed over me.
Algunos cargan mi cuerpo desierto 
tras su espalda
como si fuera el sendero
un día cruzado hacía mí.
