<p align="left"><h3>Introduction: Reading <i>Dictar Y Recordar</i> For the Home-Yet-To-Come</h3> 
<p>What is in front of you is a wager to make recognizable an “event,” which may or may not “happen.” The communication of its existence is not guaranteed. By the end of your engagement with this site, my wager will be tested on your ability to recognize why the content itself is worthy of the noun I’m using to introduce it. “Event” is not used lightly as I am trying to convey magnitude, as a signifier for lived experience(s) discursively organized to rearrange History and Geography. In other words, this “event” is worthy of the name if it produces recognizable changes in how reality is perceived. Events are customarily recognized as such through proper names, in this case, the event is the home-yet-to-come. But before I spell out what this name refers to, I’d like to discuss “where” this “event” is taking place. The home-yet-to-come is possible to be thought of thanks to my translation of ten memories collected and transcribed by California-artist, with Honduras background, Paul Ramirez Jonas.<p>
