<p></p>
What is in front of you is a wager to make recognizable an “event,” which may or may not “happen.” The communication of its existence is not guaranteed. By the end of your engagement with this site, my wager will be tested on your ability to recognize why the content itself is worthy of the noun I’m using to introduce it. “Event” is not used lightly as I am trying to convey magnitude, as a signifier for lived experience(s) discursively organized to rearrange History and Geography. In other words, this “event” is worthy of the name if it produces recognizable changes in how reality is perceived. Events are customarily recognized as such through proper names, in this case, the event is the home-yet-to-come. But before I spell out what this name refers to, I’d like to discuss “where” this “event” is taking place. The home-yet-to-come is possible to be thought of thanks to my translation of ten memories collected and transcribed by California-artist, with Honduras background, Paul Ramirez Jonas.
<p></p>
Jonas executed in 2010 a performance installation piece called <i>Dictar Y Recordar</i>, at <i>La Mancha de Tomate</i>, an independent art space in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. For the performance, Jonas invited anyone in Tegucigalpa to come to the art space  and dictate memories of Honduras in an attempt to “do the impossible: write a complete history of Honduras<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>,” in the span of 24 hours. Imagine walking into a long and narrow room, stacks of papers held together and hanging against the wall thanks to clothespins and clothesline, allowing you to peruse through the documents: to read the words shaped after the map of Honduras, to take a look at the longer texts and to admire the drawings that accompany them. You see how the stacks grow, the wall gets more covered, as the day goes by.

                                                                  <p></p> 
Desks run along the walls of the narrow room, each covered by dark purple or blue tablecloths with type-recorders clinking away as volunteer typists listen to the recollections of participants. You walked in out of curiosity while strolling through the capital, but most of the people in the room are indigenous and non-indigenous, female and male activists from all over the country’s rural areas, arranged to be there by Jonas himself. His interest in writing a complete history of Honduras is linked to the country’s political instability, “a country that has almost as many governments as years of independence.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> This desire to write a “complete history,” Jonas confided to me while sharing dumplings at the community garden located on Elizabeth Street in New York City, is also informed by the political unrest that forced him, while growing up, to constantly move in between Pomona, CA and Honduras. The timing of the performance installation is also crucial: 2010 is merely a year after the coup of 2009, which the National Party staged in collaboration with the U.S. government against Liberal-Leftist, then-President, Manuel ‘Mel’ Zelaya. 
<p></p>
The coup prevented Zelaya’s contestation of a constitutional prohibition against running for a second term, which was instituted in the 1982 constitution in order to prevent the monopoly of power that characterized much of Honduran government soon after its independence from Spain and throughout the 19th and 20th century. Zelaya’s “challenge” to democracy was: printing a fourth question in the ballot boxes for general elections, asking people if they would allow him to run for a second term. It was unclear whether a “yes” would immediately result in overwriting the constitution or what exactly would happen after the results.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Zelaya had a support base that consisted mostly of the young, rural poor with varying support from urban residents of various socioeconomic levels. His rhetoric borrowed heavily from the revolutionary discourse of Marxist-inspired labor organizers that was popular and widespread throughout the country during the 1980s. He also increasingly became closer to Hugo Chavez, making his “connection” to “Communism” more obvious through an anti-U.S. imperialism sentiment. However, the executions of his “revolutionary” policies were mired with corruption scandals and lack of funds. His “revolutionary” stance was also constantly criticized based on his violent family history: Zelaya is member of a family of elite, rural landowners. His father, the family patriarch also named Manuel Zelaya, ordered the Horcones Massacre of 1975, in which 15 religious leaders, students, and campesinos were killed by the military while protesting against the Zelaya family land grabs of communal and indigenous land in Olancho, the Western part of Honduras.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> 
<p></p>
Zelaya’s polysemic position within a domestic/international landscape must be taken into account to appreciate how it is that his actions merited a coup that took place at an international scale: not only in terms of participants but also media coverage. Because of his close alliance with Venezuela and his espousing of leftist language, Zelaya must have represented a threat to the hegemonic world order spearheaded by the U.S., established in the region through traumatic violence during its occupation of Honduras to persecute “Communists” in the 80s. He revived tensions suppressed ever since the end of U.S. occupation in the 90s - silences and ellipses that constitute the geography of the globalized world today, lived experiences that have been prevented from reaching the category of “event,” a condition of possibility for migration and its labor from Honduras to be “cheap” for the U.S.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> By staging a coup, hegemonic world order was maintained. “Democracy” was “safeguarded” in order to ensure the condition of possibility for the proliferation of cheap labor. I do not mean to suggest that Zelaya staying in power was going to change the conditions of migration as source of cheap labor, but staying in power might have changed the direction of the labor from U.S. to other contesting powers for hegemony, the Venezuela of mid and late 2000s.
