<div align="center"><h3>Introduction: Reading <i>Dictar Y Recordar</i> For the Home-Yet-To-Come</h3></div>
<p></p>
What is in front of you is a wager to make recognizable an “event,” which may or may not “happen.” The communication of its existence is not guaranteed. By the end of your engagement with this site, my wager will be tested on your ability to recognize why the content itself is worthy of the noun I’m using to introduce it. “Event” is not used lightly as I am trying to convey magnitude, as a signifier for lived experience(s) discursively organized to rearrange History and Geography. In other words, this “event” is worthy of the name if it produces recognizable changes in how reality is perceived. Events are customarily recognized as such through proper names, in this case, the event is the home-yet-to-come. But before I spell out what this name refers to, I’d like to discuss “where” this “event” is taking place. The home-yet-to-come is possible to be thought of thanks to my translation of 10 memories collected and transcribed by artist Paul Ramirez Jonas.
<p></p>
Jonas executed in 2010 a performance installation piece called <i>Dictar Y Recordar</i>, at <i>La Mancha de Tomate</i>, an independent art space in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. For the performance, Jonas invited anyone in Tegucigalpa to come to the art space  and dictate memories of Honduras in an attempt to “do the impossible: write a complete history of Honduras,”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> in the span of 24 hours. Imagine walking into a long and narrow room, stacks of papers held together and hanging against the wall thanks to clothespins and clothesline, allowing you to peruse through the documents: to read the words shaped after the map of Honduras, to take a look at the longer texts and to admire the drawings that accompany them. You see how the stacks grow, the wall gets more covered, as the day goes by.

<p></p> 
Desks run along the walls of the narrow room, each covered by dark purple or blue tablecloths with type-recorders clinking away as volunteer typists listen to the recollections of participants. You walked in out of curiosity while strolling through the capital, but most of the people in the room are indigenous and non-indigenous, female and male activists from all over the country’s rural areas, arranged to be there by Jonas himself. His interest in writing a complete history of Honduras is linked to the country’s political instability, “a country that has almost as many governments as years of independence.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> This desire to write a “complete history,” Jonas confided to me while sharing dumplings at the community garden located on Elizabeth Street in New York City, is also informed by the political unrest that forced him, while growing up, to constantly move in between Pomona, CA and Honduras. The timing of the performance installation is also crucial: 2010 is merely a year after the coup of 2009, which the National Party staged in collaboration with the U.S. government against Liberal-Leftist, then-President, Manuel ‘Mel’ Zelaya. 
<p></p>
The coup prevented Zelaya’s contestation of a constitutional prohibition against running for a second term, which was instituted in the 1982 constitution in order to prevent the monopoly of power that characterized much of Honduran government soon after its independence from Spain and throughout the 19th and 20th century. Zelaya’s “challenge” to democracy was: printing a fourth question in the ballot boxes for general elections, asking people if they would allow him to run for a second term. It was unclear whether a “yes” would immediately result in overwriting the constitution or what exactly would happen after the results.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Zelaya had a support base that consisted mostly of the young, rural poor with varying support from urban residents of various socioeconomic levels. His rhetoric borrowed heavily from the revolutionary discourse of Marxist-inspired labor organizers that was popular and widespread throughout the country during the 1980s. He also increasingly became closer to Hugo Chavez, making his “connection” to “Communism” more obvious through an anti-U.S. imperialism sentiment. However, the executions of his “revolutionary” policies were mired with corruption scandals and lack of funds. His “revolutionary” stance was also constantly criticized based on his violent family history: Zelaya is member of a family of elite, rural landowners. His father, the family patriarch also named Manuel Zelaya, ordered the Horcones Massacre of 1975, in which 15 religious leaders, students, and campesinos were killed by the military while protesting against the Zelaya family land grabs of communal and indigenous land in Olancho, the Western part of Honduras.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> 
<p></p>
Zelaya’s polysemic position within a domestic/international landscape must be taken into account to appreciate how it is that his actions merited a coup that took place at an international scale: not only in terms of participants but also media coverage. Because of his close alliance with Venezuela and his espousing of leftist language, Zelaya must have represented a threat to the hegemonic world order spearheaded by the U.S., established in the region through traumatic violence during its occupation of Honduras to persecute “Communists” in the 80s. He revived tensions suppressed ever since the end of U.S. occupation in the 90s - silences and ellipses that constitute the geography of the globalized world today, lived experiences that have been prevented from reaching the category of “event,” a condition of possibility for migration and its labor from Honduras to be “cheap” for the U.S.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> By staging a coup, hegemonic world order was maintained. “Democracy” was “safeguarded” in order to ensure the condition of possibility for the proliferation of cheap labor. I do not mean to suggest that Zelaya staying in power was going to change the conditions of migration as source of cheap labor, but staying in power might have changed the direction of the labor from U.S. to other contesting powers for hegemony, the Venezuela of mid and late 2000s.
<p></p>
It is necessary to discuss Zelaya and the global relationships that precipitated his ousting because the home-yet-to-come becomes legible through the translation of stories that are narrating the speakers’ experiences during during the coup and how it elicited, in many of them, memories about the political persecution “Communist” activists experienced during the 80s. Jonas’s piece is interested in collection and transcription in order to create a history of a place. In transcribing and exhibiting the memories, Jonas creates an immersive space where history is alive through the circulation and representation of memories as an interactive archive. However, by insisting to package and present to an audience the stories as a "history" of a self-evident and clearly differentiated space known as "Honduras," Jonas' performance installation obscures the fluid geographical and temporal dynamics expressed within the stories. Seriously considering these dynamics might forces us to reframe the archive as a "history" of how the global present is constituted as is. This is where I’m incredibly grateful to Jonas for allowing me to use the material he gathered at my discretion. From the 140 stories collected, I have selected to translate and make digitally available 10 of them. The act of translating this stories demanded me to do historical research on the 2009 coup and Honduras under U.S. occupation during the 80s. It is through the translations and the research that footnotes each publicly accessible (and editable) entry that I hope to make legible an event: the experience of the home-yet-to-come as a structure of feeling in contemporary capitalist globalization that hinges upon the desire for change that secures the ability to reproduce one’s being in the world, a desire that happens right at the moment when the change itself is dissipating from the horizon of actualization.
<p></p>
I will come back to the home-yet-to-come, but at this moment is necessary to emphasize that Jonas’ piece misses the opportunity to circulate the stories in larger histories and geographies by insisting to understand the memories as a “national history” of a discrete, self-evident space called Honduras. But how can we more productively think of this signifier, “Honduras”? In Nandita Sharma’s argument against theories of globalization that conclude globalization results in “the loss of national sovereignty with the resultant destruction of democratic forms of governance<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>,” Sharma offers a useful account of how globalization and nation-states interact: “The problem with nationalist approaches to understanding issues of state sovereignty and capitalist power lies in the assumption that sometime before this period of globalization nation states were actually sovereign...Regarding national states as having once been sovereign simply belies the historical record of how state practices have been a part of, and not a populist response against global capitalist social relations.”<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Rather than understanding “Honduras” as a sovereign nation, it is more productive to think of “Honduras” as a signifier for how state practices participate in the institutionalization and materialization of global capitalism in a specific geographic region, an undertaking that becomes highly productive given the position of the post-coup government: “Honduras is open for business.”<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>
<p></p>
Honduras as a way to refer to state practices institutionalizing and materializing global capitalism could not be more fitting given what happened this past January when Juan Orlando Hernandez was sworn into his second presidential term. Such sentence should puzzle the reader given our discussion on Zelaya: Hernandez, eight years later, managed to do the exact same thing Zelaya tried to do. Despite confirmed associations with the international drug trade, despite accusations of power consolidation across governmental branches, despite international organizations warning about the high possibility of electoral fraud and the intense rioting of a big sector of the population against a second term (Fuera JOH<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> has been ringing through the streets since December 2017) - despite all of this, the closest U.S. ally in the War on Drugs in Central America has been allowed to continue in power and further policies that are oriented to benefit the market, to facilitate an appropriation of resources (both in terms of land and people) to be managed for the market through the entity of “Honduras.” A bulk of his policies focus on infrastructure and urbanization, with Hong Kong and Singapore as models for “cities of the future”<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> that need to be emulated, an emphasis that reflects the current mode of accumulation by dispossession, urbanization itself. Therefore, the 2009 coup can be retroactively understood as facilitating capitalist accumulation, a facilitation that has been secured and sedimented through Hernandez’s second term and its focus on urbanization as way to actualize “economic development,” which is the same as saying “to facilitate the preferred mode of capitalist accumulation in the current historical juncture.” Instead of threatening the hegemonic world order, Hernandez was allowed to stay precisely because he upholds and furthers it through the openness to the current market of planetary urbanization.
<p></p>
By shifting what "Honduras" refers to, I’m suggesting that the memories gathered by Jonas are more than pages in a history book of a country. The stories probe into what it feels like to live through the contradictions of capitalist globalization and the desires that take place as the contradictions are lived and understood at the level of feeling. The stories can collectively be seen as conceptually making legible the event of the home-yet-to-come, an experience of waiting and getting ready for the emancipatory change that will allow one to finally feel at a “home” where one can imagine oneself into the future.  How this event arises from the translation of the stories and the memories they recount is the concern of the next section. But before that, below you will find the 10 translations with their respective footnotes and the original text. Please browse through the stories before you continue reading. Feel free to offer alternative translations or suggestions by making changes on the Google Docs themselves. Any alteration will be reviewed before approval.

<div align="center"><h3>The “Arrival” of the Home-Yet-to-Come: A Close-Reading of Select Stories from Jonas’ <i>Dictar Y Recordar</i>
</h3></div>
<p></p>
All of the texts translated describe events around the 2009 coup or similar memories of persevering through political tumultuousness that threatened the speakers’ existence in space. The act of translation has allowed me to close-read for a structure of feeling that might be able to describe what the stories are collectively aspiring for in the context of their experience of capitalist globalization, which the 2009 coup and the U.S occupation of Honduras in the 80s are manifestations of.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> This structure of feeling is also the event my translation is betting on making discernible: the experience of the home-yet-to-come as an active longing for (emancipatory) change that was perceived as on the way to its realization but was violently interrupted, thus exacerbating the threat to the body, the very condition that the desired change was imagined to address. The stories come from a cross-section of society, which allows me to also point out that the home-yet-to-come is differently experienced by the speakers in relation to their construction as subjects within the spectrum of Honduran humanity, which influences the ways in which speakers also narrate a sense of a “provisional home” through sociality that allows one to <i>live</i> through the precarity of the everyday while waiting for the home-yet-to-come.
<p></p>
The experience of the home-yet-to-come is an attempt to describe and think seriously the enunciation of a desire for change in the face of violence to the body. Let’s take a look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uHqGn_OkoQ6bfFcmvGNzPF6HwUtx-UEHrVWUb50Nwfc/edit?usp=sharing">Carlos</a>. His account takes place in October of 2009, when Zelaya managed to sneak back into the country after he was ousted and “holed up” at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa to prevent Honduran authorities from arresting him.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> While there, Zelaya was surrounded by his supporters, members of social movement La Resistencia, which Carlos is a part of. His account mirrors the viscerally-felt turmoil through the very way in which he recounts the violence experienced. Every time he mentions what it felt like to be under tear gas attack or to have the military aim sonic weapons at them, Carlos uses the phrase “at that moment.” Its repetition comes to function almost as a sign, constantly pointing back the reader to the very corporeal aspect of the experience that cannot be conveyed by language alone. There’s an urgency in Carlos repetition, most noticeable seen in the Spanish through the lack of punctuation: his sentences keep going and going, comma after comma, in an attempt to make present the serious threat posed to his being. However, this urgency is never a way Carlos victimizes himself, as even when his body was on the verge of expulsion from the world, the lesson he learned was: “In the end we substantiated something we already knew: the struggle was going to be tough; despite fear, it has to be fought if we want to see our country change.” In using “country,” Carlos frames his desire for change in relation to the physical space that is threatening his very being. What he is willing to fight for is this ability to <i>be</i>, the desire at the center of the experience of the home-yet-to-come.
<p></p>
Although the home-yet-to-come is enunciated from the point of view of supporters of la Resistencia, the event itself refers to a visceral desire for a change that is not tied with any particular existing political vision. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iI04x1ekIpSHCCnVC4U0mt1xDX-6cWN-sHh_2U_u5fg/edit?usp=sharing">Anonymous 11</a> is helpful in this regards as it is an account that expresses a desire for change in the home/country without taking an explicit support of La Resistencia as a political movement but still longing to address the violence to its supporters. Anonymous 11 describes what happened right after the coup when Zelaya had not yet managed to sneak back into Honduras and instead was in Nicaragua taunting authorities by stepping back-and-forth between the boundary separating the two countries.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>  Anonymous 11 is a stark contrast in terms of how the events are narrated: the tone is matter-of-fact, almost detached. This might be related to their different subject positions: Carlos is enacting the struggle, while Anonymous 11 is an “observer.” The ability to observe the struggle rather than be in it requires an ontological  security that is reflected in how Anonymous 11 got there: “I traveled in a vehicle that held international journalists, and for that reason, the military and police we ran into on our way there did not try to stop us.”  In their proximity to mechanisms that produce transnational commodities such as news, Anonymous 11 can claim a more certain being in the world which allows them to “witness” but not enough to name themselves (the speaker decided to stay anonymous for a reasons of safety). Regardless of this ability to claim proximity to ontological being, the desire for a change is still there, as seen not only by the moments of symbolic acts of  solidarity (singing the national anthem after finding Magdiel’s dead body) but also in how the story ends: “I left the place by noon in the same way I had arrived, but many were left stranded by the coup government that decreed through national broadcast a state of siege for El Paraiso...people could not move back to their places of origin because the police prevented them. I know this because I personally went to the police station in Danli, and there they had detained women, children and men they found on the road.”  A desire for change is expressed not because Anonymous 11 is explicitly supporting Zelaya and La Resistencia, but because the current social conditions prevent a reproduction of being in the world for certain bodies within the geographic space known as Honduras.
<p></p>
Thus, home-yet-to-come refers to the experience of an active longing for a change that is concerned not with a particular vision of politics, but rather for the sake of the body and its ability to be in the world. Furthermore, the desired change is one that was or seemed to be <i>on its way</i> to actualization but was prevented from doing so. The 2009 coup happened in the middle of preparations for a constitutional change: the ability for Zelaya to run a second term. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWwqO-ve9VRbedT3mRe0QImsZgARdfLI3Edao3FWlIE/edit?usp=sharing">Carmen's</a> account starts three days before the coup when Congress and military confiscated ballots and ballot boxes that contained Zelaya’s controversial fourth question: should there be a referendum on the constitution to allow a president to run a second term? Carmen vividly describes how she and other supporters of “la cuarta urna” (the fourth ballot box referendum) gathered in front of the Presidential Palace, how Zelaya lead them to the army base in the outskirts of the city to take away the ballot boxes and how they organized themselves to distribute the boxes throughout the country without the help of Congress. Carmen dwells on the details as a way to underline the people’s active participation in a change they considered necessary to improve their material conditions. Doing so also turns the moment when the coup succeeded into a moment of heartbreak and sorrow: “We spent the night like that - sad, afraid and cold. At dawn, disoriented people, as if suddenly our dreams of justice and liberty had been stolen.” “Stolen” criminalizes that lack of change and places it within an economy of agency: it is not that the change that allows for the body to continue <i>being</i> in the world simply disappeared. Instead, someone or something actively prevented it from becoming a reality, someone took it away despite Carmen’s and other people’s labor. 
<p></p>
At this point some might be wondering why is it that I’m utilizing the framework of “home” when none of the stories discussed so far have referred to the location of where the desire for change takes place as such.  Instead, they have referred to this desire for change in relation to a country, to Honduras. While the stories narrate to themselves a desire for change through a national framework, what they are really trying to describe is the universal and visceral experience of needing to feel at home somewhere, with Honduras/country being the basic unit with which this feeling is understood as being possible. Such longing for home that gets territorialized within the imaginary space of the nation comes to the fore with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJnanJxyixnX2Ry4s6_wwKzaV-O_YEiN2OppZjVA1aY/edit?usp=sharing">Jorge</a>, who recounts how he ran away from home at the age of 17 to go work at a bar in California before returning to Honduras for Zelaya’s inauguration address. California was important to Jorge’s ability to <i>be</i> in the world: “Because I lived in California I learned how to calm down, to relax and to see the world not as a challenge but as a place full of opportunities where goals can be reached and dreams can be achieved with some sacrifice.” Learning how to “calm down” and to “relax,” both verbs that refer to the body, becomes crucial when Jorge returns to Honduras and experiences suicidal thoughts. The fact that he must leave Honduras to learn how to “relax” suggests that the change desired is for one that will allow Jorge to feel relaxed in Honduras instead of the sinking despair that gets exacerbated with the coup:  “each day the destiny, the palate and the reality of this people who made me who I am (and who I think of with every step I take) is going to change, even if I don’t move to the front or to the back but instead each time I feel ‘hondo Honduras.” Jorge ends his account believing in the urgency of change, a change needed even if he feels “hondo Honduras"<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> - sinking in deeper depths, deep in Honduras. But in contrasting this sinking despair in Honduras with the ability to be relaxed in California, Jorge’s account suggests that what the change desired for is really about is about making the body feel at home on a given physical space. 
<p></p>
Understanding the stories as narrating a certain experience of longing for the home that was <i>on its way</i> but was prevented from doing so (home-yet-to-come) allows us to tease out the visceral and universal desire for ontological security that home is a figure for. Ofelia Cuevas’ article “Welcome to My Cell” offers us a way to understand how home functions as “a precondition for any meaningful conception of personhood, for without the future, the self dissolves into the evanescence of an eternally fragmented present.”<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> The desire for the country (the home) to change is a desire to feel “‘ontological security,’ the state of emotive well-being and constancy necessary for developing a stable personal identity.”<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> The desire for home is a desire for an experience of <i>being here</i> that allows the “I” to imagine existing in the future. Vilem Flusser also suggests the importance of satisfying this desire when he writes, “Without a home, I would be unconscious, that is, without a home, I would not actually exist. A home is how I find myself in the world - if at all. It is primary.”<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>Therefore, home can be understood as a shorthand to refer to the feeling of belonging to a space that allows the subject who imagines themselves at home to project their desires into the future in a way that perpetuates their <i>being</i>.
<p></p>
If home is understood in such a way, “Honduras” (both the imagined sovereign nation and the state practices that institutionalize and materialize global capitalism) has failed to upheld its promise as the imagined unit (home = nation) where belonging <i>ought</i> to take place. Honduras as a home is a promise that has not been actualized which is why the speakers engage in the different actions they describe, in order to make this promise (where belonging aligns with body and space) come true. This very feeling, regardless of the contents that are seemed as able to fulfil the promise (Zelaya winning the referendum, Zelaya leaving the country, Zelaya returning etc..) is what the home-yet-to-come highlights in order to make a demand for different forms of justice. The home-yet-to-come is useful to be read in relation to Derrida’s coinage of “messianicity without messianism.” He developed the idea in his 1993 book <i>Specters of Marx</i>, which was written after the global collapse of communism. In arguing how the “spirit of Marx” is even more relevant after the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall (one must also remember this would be after the persecutions of “Communists” under U.S. occupied Honduras), Derrida posed messianicity as a way to talk about the structure of the experience of the “emancipatory promise” that does not rely on any messianicisms (any content such as Christianity, Marxism, Democracy, Communism, etc...) but instead as “a certain experience of the promise that one can try to liberate from any dogmatics and even from any metaphysico-religious determination, from any messianism. And a promise must promise to be kept, that is, not to remain "spiritual" or "abstract, but to produce events, new effective forms of action, practice, organization, and so forth.”<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> Home-yet-to-come can be seen as participating in the structure of messianicity without messianism insofar as it is a way to highlight the experience of desire for an emancipation one was actively preparing to actualize, but whose possibility of being was suddenly interrupted. This interruption threatens the very ability for the body to exist in space. It is because the desire for change is motivated by the threat to being in space that the home-yet-to-come demands new “events, new effective forms of action, practice, organization.” The very existence of the desire is a signifier that the promise has not been met, that the body’s ability to <i>be</i> is still threatened, that the home has yet to come.
<p></p>
But it is not merely that home-yet-to-come underlines this desire that points to how the body is still threatened. The desire’s existence also opens up time and space to how the body has been threatened, how the justice for the present needs to be haunted by the ghosts of these threats. Derrida postulates that messianicity “mandates that we interrupt the ordinary course of things, time and history here-now; it is inseparable from an affirmation of otherness and justice.”<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> This interruption of the “here-now” takes place through an “exorcism” that allows the haunting of ghosts, “not in order to chase away the ghosts, but this time to grant them the right, if it means making them come back alive.”<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> Ghosts can be said to abound in the translated accounts if we understand by ghosts the presence of memories beyond 2009 - the ways in which the coup activate memories of political persecution during the U.S. occupation of Honduras in the 80s. Ghosts figure quite explicitly in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZXJrGTS8FyfyiVyfKJ5cpIavZB058G2Dje6gRnSyqrc/edit?usp=sharing">Nora's</a> account. Nora feels 2009 as a failure of the actualization of the emancipatory promise embodied by Zelaya just how she felt the failure of labor organizing she engaged in during the 80s. Nora narrates how this pain almost drove her to suicide (her attempted suicide is narrated as taken place on the same date as the coup but three or four years later). She ends her story with an apparition: “In the crowd I saw Fidel Martinez, Tomas Nativi and so many of the compas who I only knew by their pseudonyms. They all got lost in the crowd. At the end, I ran into Francisco Morazan, who, riding a horse with sword in hand, was seeing us and taking attendance. When walking past me, I held my posture and said to him: “General, here we are present...Patria or death, my general” Tomas Nativi and Fidel Martinez<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> are the names of leftist activists from Honduras who “disappeared” (a.k.a. were successfully silenced/murdered by the U.S.-Honduras state). Their “presence” links the coup with the U.S. occupation of Honduras: two moments when the desire for emancipation perseveres despite the foreclosure of the emancipation itself. Nora conjures her disappeared comrades (she was working in leftist organizing alongside with them during the 80s) as soldiers presenting themselves to Morazan, one of the most respected Presidents of Honduras who tried to establish a Central American Federation in the 1800s. In presenting herself to Morazan as a soldier ready to die, Nora conjures Morazan as a judge, as a figure that represents the honor of what her imagined home is. This allows Nora to demand a form of justice that takes the sacrifice of her comrades into account, a justice that disrupts the here-now through the very way in which the here-now is understood, not as static present but as full of ghosts. Respectively, Honduras in 2017, the Honduras that is opened for business, is not a result of the justice of democracy, is not the emancipatory promise but in fact another instance where ghosts are needed to demand new visions of justice.
<p></p>
However useful messianicity is to help discern the desires for change that are at the center of the experience of home-yet-to-come as an “event” that demands new visions of justice, messianicity cannot account for a phenomenon narrated in many if not most of the accounts translated: even when the speakers are describing their desire for the fulfilment of the emancipatory promise that seems to not come, they do so with hope and conviction. There’s a degree of <i>being</i> that provides the speakers with the energy and desire to live the next day in the face of precarity and violence. In narrating her willingness to die for her vision of patria, Nora finds the grounds for ontological being that allows her to imagine herself into a future. It is as if dying while engaging in revolutionary struggle <i>with her comrades and role model</i> (in the condition of sociality) came to function as a "provisional home” since it is from this narrative stance that Nora finds “closure” as a subject who survived to tell the tale.

The account by <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12B7AWY_ezrGB_VPAaAQpD71VpntynpvdKakLEW4hb2o/edit?usp=sharing">Anonymous 5</a> also exhibits the presence of a “provisional home” in the shape of sociality that becomes the grounds for <i>enough</i> ontological security to  allow the desire for emancipatory promise to even be enunciated. The provisional home as sociality can be located within the memory of the relationship with the father, relived vis-a-vis participation in “revolutionary struggle,” since it is this relationship that gives the speaker the desire to even narrate the story. The story starts with a justification for talking about the father because he is connected with the history of Honduras. The father bookends the story as a fighter for the noble cause: “8 days before his death I told him that some people wanted to pay him tribute for everything he did throughout his life. He started crying, saying how he didn’t deserve it. He then told me about the time he worked with refugees from the war in El Salvador: he was machine-gunned by a Honduras-U.S. helicopter and it was then that I understood that I was with someone who, far from being my father, had risked his own life without wielding a gun to defend the noble and just causes.” This specific vision of the father gives the speaker the ontological stability to state: “Even now I’m still thinking of what happened - how in June I risked my own life. However, because of his departure, I was no longer afraid of death. Even now I ask myself what it would be like if my father was here, when the people have finally broken their chains and asserted their hopes for a new world. But whatever happens from now on, I will go tell him when the earth embraces me too.” The memory his father confided before dying becomes a framing device that allows the speaker to imagine their own actions as trying to actualize the noble cause in a similar way. Such conviction must satisfy in some degree the desire for emancipation, it must be pleasurable but not enough to <i>satiate</i> the desire. The memory of the father functions as framing device that gives meaning to the speaker’s actions. Without it, the struggle cannot be continued because it cannot even be narrated since it loses meaning. Therefore, the relationship with the father, relived through the memory of him as a noble fighter who is the inspiration for the speaker’s own actions, is a narrative instance of the provisional home insofar as it functions as the grounds from which the desire for emancipatory promise can be enunciated, making everyday life bearable, worth living.
<p></p>
"Provisional homes" that take place in sociality are framing devices that give meaning to the active waiting for emancipatory change, which not only makes everyday life worth living for the speakers, but also become the grounds for confrontations, negotiations and actualization of some degree of change. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1soe6hFWoOUd9GqR2zwEKiKGmzNNgeov-4R66iDUcaVk/edit?usp=sharing">Fabrisio's</a> narrative is insightful in this regard as it narrates the story of how the village of Sabanagrande became “modern” at the expense of U.S. military, whose presence is an organizing force within the diegesis as seen by how Fabrision opens up with explaining why they used to go to a hill in the village: “We used to go there to smoke our Pinares and to take advantage of its location to look out for the arrival of aguastaras. We knew that each time aguastaras convoys drove around, they’d bring with them chocolate and peanut butter. We also knew that they drove by at like 4, three hours after the gringo planes usually broke the sound barrier and made the world tremble.” U.S. presence permeates Fabrisio’s imagination; it becomes a referent for organizing time and behavior (the trembling that happens 4 hours before the arrival of military convoys is a sign to start climbing up the hill). But this presence is not one that renders the “we” of Fabrisio’s narrative helpless or submissive - their attitude toward U.S. military is of irreverent defiance, as seen by the neologism coined to refer to the military: aguastaras. The phrase, like “gringo,” has a deprecatory tone and it was used during the 80s to refer to U.S. military in Honduras. The word itself comes from the name of the U.S. operation, Ahua Taras II, which was a Miskito phrase borrowed by the army meaning "Big Pine" and then taken up and "bastardized" into Spanish by Fabrisio and others in order to insult them.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> This irreverence takes place in a social context: it is spoken by a “we.” The sense of community with Sabanagrande that allows Fabrisio to narrate as a “we” can be understood as the site where the provisional home gives meaning to their actions - a meaning that allows him to narrate a denial of U.S. power over everyday life as seen when the aguastaras’ trucks crash and all the soda cans they were carrying spill out into the freeway: “The gringo soldiers got mad and fought with the children for their treasure, screaming: “NO, NO, NOO, NOOO! They’re the sodas for the party.” With bags up to the brim, we yelled back at them: “Fuck you!”” The humor of the scene is undeniable, it partakes in the irreverence embedded within "aguastaras," but also underlines the powerful effect of the children, carrying sacks of soda cans, saying “Fuck you.” This affront allows for another enunciation of a provisional home while waiting for the home-yet-to-come (the desire for a change that will get rid of the "gringos" who make the world tremble), then moment when Sabanagrande (“we”) becomes modern: “Never before had a village with dirt roads be seen to have so many aluminum cans. Sabanagrande had entered modernity. We all agreed: Doctor Pepper tastes delicious if you drink it with corn rosquillas.” The taking of soda cans, most of them brands they had never heard of, allows the “we” of Sabanagrande to narrate itself differently: as “modern,” as no longer inferior to the U.S. because of its dirt roads. The feeling of becoming modern does not mean an undoing of U.S occupation (the threat to the body is still there, the home is yet to come) but it imbues the everyday with pleasure, which is not only the pleasure of a new sensation (Doctor Pepper with corn rosquillas) but also the pleasure of a successful confrontation that led to some change in their world. 
<p></p>
In regards to the provisional home through sociality as a framing device that allows for the wait of the home-yet-to-come to be a livable one that can be negotiated, both of Maira’s accounts, which revel in her <i>difference</i> as a member of the Garifuna community, suggest that for the bodies of Black Garifuna people within the geographic space termed “Honduras,” sociality as Garifunas is the only form in which a grounds for being is allowed, given the persistence of structural racism and a settler colonial logic. The desire for change that demands new forms of justice that is highlighted by what I’ve called the home-yet-to-come is still present, but in her narratives there is no gesture to imagine this change happening at the level of <i>national change</i> - the hope lies solely in their ability to remain in the world <i>as Garifuna</i>.  Maira is the only account that performs a racialization, a move necessary to explain her everyday: “In the year 1990, we had to come to the city and experienced a lot of difficulty because we spoke only Garifuna and they spoke Spanish. We suffered from racism. They called us “Coconut-eating Negro” or “Fish-eating Negro.” Notice that 1990 is the moment that Anonymous 5 characterized as the time when “repression was over” - for Maira, 1990, is simply the time when she had to experience racism in her move to the capital for the sake of receiving education. Despite the adversity experienced during her internal migration, Maira is able to learn Spanish, educate herself and still assert: “we want to say, as the young people, that we continue to believe in our traditions and cultures, those our parents and grandparents fostered.” The ability to continue to believe in the inherited traditions of her community makes the everyday experience of racism bearable, it allows her not only to exist but also provides the means to live: “Another thing that was very important in the garifuna communities was home remedies. Since the state did not know about these communities and offered no medical assistance, those who attended our ill were the healers, the midwives and elders who offered natural remedies that healed people from their pain.” Maira makes clear how the state was not only absent but belligerent to the existence of her and her community, even when the U.S. occupation was over. Their departure (or even Zelaya’s) does not mean a failure or success (as it does to most of the speakers in the stories). Instead, it is not even thought of within the narrative. It is simply another event in a series of events that have taken place in the same geographic space where those in control have continued to render Garifunas structurally as valuable cheap labor, starting with how they got to the North coast of Trujillo in Honduras as exiles from their own island of St. Vincent by the British troops in 1796, a move that allowed them to employ Garifunas as workforce within the then-British territory.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> 
<p></p>
For Maira the home-yet-to-come, the desire for change that actively prepares her to survive and live life as a Garifuna, is the promise of the stranger’s home, the provisional home: <br>
<div style="text-align: left"><blockquote cite="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YMfn4rZLE5AwyYQZ1y5Q90QX0u9JajPiv-OVkDbPX_A/edit">
“One day we were coming back from traveling with her and we had to stay at a house of a family who wasn’t garifuna. The lady of the house sold food so my mom woke up at five in the morning and asked the lady what could she help her with. She told her to grind the corn and my mother lovingly and laboriously helped her, later on making me join the work too. We were around fifteen travelers in there who had been trapped by the bad weather while on the road. We all asked this family, who lived in the community of Los Farallones, for shelter and we all helped with grinding, sweeping, etc. We were in that family’s house for 2 days. Once the weather started changing for good, we decided to leave and my mom asked her how much money did we owe her. The lady said that everything we had eaten was the fruit of our own labor. We owed her nothing. When we left, she gave me the following advice: ‘Daughter, whenever you go to a stranger’s house, earn the owners’ goodwill and you will always have the door open for you’”
</blockquote></div>
Knowing how to inhabit the “stranger’s home” becomes a truth to be passed down, to “keep permanently on my mind” because it allows everyday survival while also giving meaning to the actions required (“earning the owners’ goodwill) to live (“always have the door open”). It becomes a framing device to interpret the need to engage in free labor for the person with whom they’re staying at or the decision to migrate to the city even when one knows racism and language will be experiences of alienation. This seeming convergence of the provisional home as the home-yet-to-come suggests that the experience of the home-yet-to-come is one that is felt and narrated differently in relation to the speakers’ construction as subject within a society that becomes cohesive through the logics of structural racism, settler coloniality and global capitalism. Maira’s account as an experience of the home-yet-to-come suggest that no notion of justice that does not disrupt the here-now to “make a home” to Garifuna and other forms of ethnic being is disruptive enough.<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>
<p></p>
From all the accounts translated, there is one that is particularly different in terms of content from the rest: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HcW61HURY0IclTuf4nN62xg3RzaLSv3t6G0RQGY6YqM/edit?usp=sharing">Mildred</a>. The text is not discussing 2009 or other memories of political persecution or racism. The account is about a “little girl” who felt embarrassed for not being able to speak English when “working” (wageless)  as a secretary for her father’s business transactions with Canadian clients. It took place in 1977, when the military junta that had been in power stepped down. Her account is relevant to our understanding of the home-yet-to-come insofar as it allows us to perceive the way in which desire for a change that will allow the body to exist <i>is also</i> the moment when the subject can reconstitute themselves into one that recognizes the change as a "reality in place," an ability differently distributed within the spectrum of a hierarchized Honduran humanity. Mildred starts her narration as a child who experiences an embarrassing exchange that makes her aware of the need for a “change” to avoid feeling shame like that again: “One day, the phone rang and it was a Canadian man asking for my father who happened to not be at home. I asked him to leave a message with me,  he dictated it and said “Thanks!” I answered: “De nanquius.” At that moment I realized that it was not pronounced like that and we both laughed before hanging up.” Because Mildred knew no English, this exchange must have taken place in Spanish with the client randomly switching to English at the end. This contingent action prompts the utterance “De nanquius,” her attempt to say “You’re welcome” and to maintain her competence (thus making her father proud). The phrase is a combination of the Spanish “De nada,” which means “you’re welcome,” and the perceived sound of English ("uiu" = “You”). The phrase suggests not only Mildred’s desire to avoid the shame at not being able to communicate and uphold the image of professionalism that had earned her praise (“He was very proud of me when clients congratulated him on the way I expressed myself on the phone”), but it is also an attempt at self-fashioning. It is Mildred’s way to constitute herself as a bilingual, eloquent daughter-entrepreneur. Whereas learning Spanish does not save Maira from racism but instead is what she must do to survive as Garifuna, learning English and French allow Mildred to constitute herself anew as someone <i>living already</i> in the reality brought upon by her desire to change: “Many doors open up unexpectedly when one is a child and cannot recognize them; only as an adult can the efforts one has done throughout life be appreciated.” The exchange motivated her to learn more languages and to become the embodiment of the praise extended by the clients and her father’s admiration for it. “Denanquius” constitutes her as the savvy little girl who will not experience such shame again, the conditions of possibility to be the person who can now open doors in life. In this case, the home-yet-to-come has arrived in adulthood, by successfully becoming the subject who has nothing to be ashamed of anymore because they speak the languages that facilitate global capitalism. The difference in the meaning of language learning (whereas for Maira it is a means to continue to survive as Garifuna and for Mildred it is a means to reinvent oneself and assert one’s claim to life, to opening its doors) suggests how the experience of desire for change that allows the body to reconstitute itself into a subject that recognizes such change as a "reality in place" is informed by that subject's position within a hierarchized “Honduran humanity” that is involved in the continuation of global capitalism.
<p></p>
To think of the home-yet-to-come and the experience of provisional homes that makes the waiting one that is livable, and from where action can be staged, is to forefront the desires that stem from the experience of global capitalism as it attempts to expel the subjects from their very being on this Earth while appropriating their labor. The here-now of the home-yet-to-come is not the diegesis of the stories or even of the art piece. The concern for justice is not one that focuses on 2009 or the 1980s, but it takes them into account when demanding changes for the here-now of the contemporary moment. The home-yet-to-come as a structure of feeling should alert us as to how is it that this desire for change is an everyday reality for people inhabiting the geographic space of “Honduras,” a “Honduras” that in engaging in the proposed projects for urbanization what is really doing is institutionalizing and materializing the prefered practices for global capitalist accumulation in the current historical juncture. Home-yet-to-come suggests that just how the U.S. occupation and the 2009 coup threatened the speakers’ existence in space, Honduras under Hernandez’s presidency is simply an “update” that facilitates the continuation of conditions that will render most of the population precarious. To escape precarity, many engage in migration as seen by Jorge. The necessary “creative destruction of urbanization”<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> will also lead to internal migration from the areas experiencing the urbanization process. What migration produces for global capitalism, in this case, is cheap labor from valuable devalued life. The here-now the home-yet-to-come seeks to interrupt is the current global infrastructure that sets in place the conditions for the production of (cheap) labor power. 
<p></p>
In staging my reading of the stories as the home-yet-to-come, one must note that the condition of possibility for this reading is the act of translation. Furthermore, translation also mediates the relationship between my project of the home-yet-to-come (this website you are reading) and Jonas’ performance installation. Translation as the structure of the relationship between my project and Jonas’s piece is what allows for the event of the home-yet-to-come to be enunciated as such. Can we therefore speak of a translation aesthetics that allow for the home-yet-to-come to be recognizable as an event? And can this phrase, translation aesthetics, refer to the modalities in which translation brings forth different events, such as home-yet-to-come, that demand new forms of justice that address the different conditions for the production of (cheap) labor power at a planetary scale? The next section will argue for a translation aesthetics by thinking through two art pieces from contemporary independent artists in conjunction with my own translation project, and by providing a framework to understand the modalities of how translation is used in all three instances to bring forth precarious wagers, events that may or may not be marked as such. 
<p></p>
<div align="center"><h3>Translation Aesthetics: Translation as Structure of Possibility for Imagining Alternative Visions of Justice</h3></div>
<p></p>
Translation aesthetics can be used to talk about ways in which semiotic objects (like this project) use translation as their structure of possibility to bring about new political possibilities. Lydia Liu posits how there’s an eventfulness to the act of translation that might allows us to understand the work of translation beyond the simplified understanding of rendering equivalent one message from one “community” to another. Translation can be seen as “a precarious wager that enables the discursive mobility of a text or a symbol, for better or for worse. The wager releases the multiplicity of the text and opens it up to an uncertain future, more often than not to an uncertain political future.”<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> The translation of the stories allows them to move in a different discursive realm, opening them up to uncertain political futures - uncertain because the future they demand is not determined nor is it guaranteed that in demanding for it any change will take place. The home-yet-to-come is thus a result of my precarious wager to translate the stories, my attempt to make “a preferential marking [that] holds the potential of turning a symbol into an event, or an event into a symbol, back and forth.”<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> Such marking renders the desires as “political evidence” use to claim for alternative visions of justice. The home-yet-to-come is the “event” that has been marked through translation as such. Translation aesthetics attunes us to how translation as structure of possibility for semiotic objects can make this preferential marking out of concern for alternative political possibilities.
<p></p>
We can start to perceive the presence of a translation aesthetics by looking at artistic interventions taking place in the contemporary global art world, such as Elyla Sinvergüenza and Guillermo Saenz’s project <a href="http://cartasmojadas.wixsite.com/wetletters">Cartas Mojadas / Wet Letters</a>, where translation as structure of possibility for the semiotic object/art piece allows for a relationship across difference to be established. In 2016, the Nicaraguan duo collected letters from indigenous, rural communities near Managua who were facing the threat of eviction from their lands with no due remuneration because the Ortega government signed a contract with infrastructure development firm HKND, run by Beijing telecommunications billionaire Wang Jing, giving it a 50-year concession to build and operate an interoceanic canal, a Nicaraguan national aspiration since the 19th century.<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> In the letters, people describe how police, military and Chinese businessmen engaged in various forms of intimidation in order to kick them out of their land. They also describe their willingness to die fighting for their lands and their ways of living. They use the letters to ask “Chinese people” for support. The artists translated the letters into Chinese, made them publicly available online and created an installation on an exhibition space in a hutong in Beijing, hand-delivering some of the letters to the hutong residents as final performance. Hutong residents were chosen because they also face the threat of dispossession without remuneration from their traditional ways of living due to Beijing’s beautification process, which is trying to get rid of “uncontrolled development and low-end entrepreneurship”<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup> to turn itself into a “city of the future.” Each letter had a QR code, which the hutong residents could scan through WeChat (ubiquitous social media app in China) in order to reply. Although the responses have not been translated yet (more funding is needed to continue the project),  in the context of an interview<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> I did with Sinverguenza, she told me many of the hutong residents responded with their own woes, asking not only where Nicaragua was but how can they help if they themselves are powerless. The goal is to translate the Chinese back to Spanish as soon as it is possible again and deliver them  to the respective people in Nicaragua, creating a pen-pal system.

<p></p>
Translation, in the context of <i>Cartas Mojadas/Wet Letters</i>, is not only the structure that allows the art project to exist in the world as such, but it is also what allows a relationship between non-aggregate communities, even when the relationship is not what the artists expected. The piece is an attempt to establish dialogue not in terms of national difference but in terms of the different mechanisms that are threatening their respective ways of being in the world. Translation as repetition (Sinvergüenza wants to keep translating in order to deepen the dialogue beyond the hutong residents' self-perception as being distant and powerless in relation to the people in Nicaragua) holds the possibility to reconstitute subjects not as utterly different and distant from one another, but as <i>interconnected</i> by their vulnerability to dispossession. The reconstitution of the political becomes possible only after they recognize each other as <i>interconnected precarious subjects</i>: the recognition of the interconnection can be speculated as a "provisional home" from where to start imagining alternative ways to achieve justice. Translation aesthetics, therefore, refer to how translation becomes the space of possibility for a relationship between non-aggregate precarious bodies to be continuously worked on for the sake of actualizing their respective claims to continue to exist in space the way they want to, without having to sell in the near future their labor as domestic or transnational migrants.
<p></p>
The recognition of the interconnection as the necessary condition for the reconstitution of the political suggests that a relationship can only happen when subjects that can recognize it have been constituted. Thus, translation aesthetics is also about the way in which translation is a technology for the constitution of subjectivity, of “I.” Translation as a technology for the constitution of the self is at play in Amy Suo Wu’s piece <a href="https://thenewnushu.hotglue.me/thunderclap">Thunderclap</a>, which re-appropriates fashion for the steganographic distribution of the writings of anarcho-feminist thinker He-Yin Zhen. Wu instrumentalized the popular Chinese fashion trend of having nonsensical English phrases printed in clothes to hide in plain sight translated quotes from Zhen’s writing, which Wu obtained after stumbling upon <i>The Birth of Chinese Feminism</i> while in residence in Beijing.<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup> For her final performance, she opened up her studio to anyone who wanted to DIY customize their clothes with patches and ribbons she had created that not only display the radical thinker’s quotes but also hide a QR code. When someone scans it through WeChat, Zhen’s writings are automatically downloaded in Chinese and English.

<p></p>
The English translation facilitates the distribution of a text that has disappeared from the contemporary context due to censorship. Thus, it becomes a wager that opens up to an uncertain future the desires and aspirations expressed in Zhen’s anti-capitalist, feminist work, which has the possibility of disrupting the here-now (beyond the already disruptive mobilization of it in an art performance piece). In circulating the translation through a steganographic practice that instrumentalizes fashion, Wu is also turning the translation into a medium for political <i>self-fashioning</i>. Wearing the ribbons and patches becomes an act of defiance to the state and solidarity across those who can relate to the text. It allows the wearers to construct themselves in relation to Zhen’s work, utilizing their bodies to not only spread censored texts but also to see themselves as agents of change in the world, a change that will allow one to live beyond the terms dictated by patriarchal, global capitalism. In doing so, the translation aesthetics of Wu’s project constitute subjects that recognize global capitalism as the polymorphous threat to the body that needs to be addressed to achieve true freedom and equality.   
<p></p>
Translation aesthetics as involved in the constitution of subjects allows us to see how translation, within the semiotic “objects” discussed, functions as a subject-making technology through which social relationships are negotiated. Such aspect of translation can be seen in my own project through “untranslatable phrases” like Fabrisio’s “aguastaras” and Mildred’s “de nanquius.” In both instances, the phrases are used to establish the speakers as subjects engaged in social relations where power is being negotiated. “Aguastaras” points not only to U.S. military in Honduras but also to speakers who use the word to disdainfully refer to their presence. “De nanquius,” as discussed earlier, allows Mildred to constitute herself as someone who attempts to avoid the shame produced by not being able to speak English. Instead of translating the words into something recognizable as an “English word,” leaving them as they are in the transcriptions confronts the reader with translation as a subject-making technology. The phrases are translations in themselves that the speakers engaged in not to “deliver a message” but to establish their own subjectivity in larger social, power relations. Their presence as a hybrid also challenges assumptions that I’m translating from “Spanish” to “English” a text about “Honduras” to the “U.S.” The words are bastardized English words, they are instances of hybridity beyond one or even two languages in the case of the Miskito roots of “aguastaras.” The multiplicity of language and the arbitrariness of linking it to a nation (Honduras = Spanish, U.S. = English) becomes legible as a political relation maintained for the sake of the continuity of hegemonic conditions.  The linking of language to homogeneity (unity) allows for it to be associated with a national (and ethnic) being, which become the grounds for implementations of the political. The untranslatable phrases challenge the assumption of a language’s unity. Translation aesthetics seek to renegotiate the political through the constitution of subjects working out difference in alternative ways that allow for a being in space to be imagined as grounds for (universal?) justice. 
<p></p>
If translation aesthetics can be a way to talk about the employment of translation as structure of possibility for certain contemporary semiotic ‘objects’ (Cartas Mojadas, Thunderclap, my own translation project) to reconstitute subjects and their social relationships in order to make claims for new visions of justice that attend to the threat to being posed by global capitalism, one “justice” that it produces is rendering legible the experience of being in transit, whose occlusion is the condition of possibility for the coherence of difference based on “nationality” or “language.” Naoki Sakai argues for the subject in transit when thinking what the subjectivity of the translator must be, one that is “internally split and multiple, and devoid of a stable positionality. At best, she can be a subject in transit, first because the translator cannot be an individual in the sense of individuum in order to perform translation, and second because she is a singular that marks an elusive point of discontinuity in the social, whereas translation is the practice of creating continuity at that singular point of discontinuity.”<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> Sakai points out how for translation to take place, the translator cannot be said to belong to one distinct “community” over “another:” she must  be in between or else how would she be translating in the first place. At the same time, Sakai posits how the very corporeality of the translator marks them as a singular point of discontinuity while still existing within the social. This paradoxical condition suggests that translation must be a way to negotiate the difference imposed by corporeality, by <i>being</i> itself: “Through the labor of the translator, the incommensurability as difference that calls for the service of the translator in the first place is negotiated and worked on...the work of translation is a practice by which the initial discontinuity between the addresser and the addressee is made continuous and recognizable.”<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup> The “incommensurability as difference,” that “initial discontinuity between addresser and addressee,” is corporeal existence itself, the fact that by being one is necessarily distant from others. The labor of translation allows for that distance to be breached through language and it is only after such labor is undertaken that incommensurability can be represented as national unity and difference: “What makes it possible to represent the initial difference as an already determined difference between one language unity and another is the work of translation itself...Only in the representation of translation can we construe the process of translation as a transfer of some message from this side to that side…[it] enables the representation of ethnic or national subjects, in spite of the presence of the translator who is always in between.”<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> The coherence of the nation and the ethnonational-linguistic subject is only possible through the labor of the subject in transit, whose very labor must be occluded for the “nation” or “language” to be cohesive to itself. Translation aesthetics as discussed so far can be understood as demanding justice precisely by reframing the subject in transit out of occlusion. Being in transit becomes an “event” that is legible through the translation aesthetics employed by the pieces where translation is the space of possibility for new events, new subjects and new relationships to take form in order to bring forth new visions of justice. Translation aesthetics revivifies the reified social relationships that have come to be understood under ethnonational and linguistic terms in order to negotiate initial incommensurability between bodies differently, in order to combat the threat to being.
<p></p>
<div align="center"><h3>Making Legible The Moment Right Before Multiplication of Labor as a Political Concern</h3></div>
<p></p>
A universal condition, that can be the basis for the actualization of alternative visions of justice, put forth by the translation aesthetics of the pieces is not the subject in transit but the subject who is negotiating the conditions that would force them to be in transit. Like the subject in transit whose work in the act of translation is foreclosed in order for translation to be able to represent itself as communication between two distinct unities, the migrant and the labor power they are forced to differentially sell is necessarily occluded for the cohesion not only of the nation, but also of global capitalism at this particular historical juncture. While none of the semiotic objects discussed so far work explicitly with the experience of migration, all of them are working with translations of texts concerned with the consequences of dispossession from one’s land and one’s ability to reproduce thereafter. They are all instances in which the source texts narrate contestations against material conditions that would lead subjects to migrate. This is clearly seen in Cartas Mojadas, where letters are translated that deal with the threat of dispossession by the canal, a threat that will force people to leave their lands and to sell their labor in order to survive, turning them into migrants either at a domestic or transnational level. With the reading of the stories connected through the structure of feeling of the home-yet-to-come, this very threat to being that enhance the possibility of migration (both Jorge and Maira have already undertook it) takes place through political instability and persecution. He-Yin Zhen’s writings are also concerned with threats to being that force a selling of one’s labor across different regimes, a selling that undermines true freedom, “from the rule of (upper-class) men and from the rule of (upper class) women.”<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> The translated texts, and the semiotic objects employing them, can be understood as contesting the conditions that threaten the speakers/addressers’ bodies and will eventually force them to be in transit, to migrate because they have been dispossessed from their ability to reproduce their own life.
<p></p>
The translations employed by the semiotic objects narrate moments before social and material conditions force subjects to be in multiple forms of transit, which is also the universal moment(s) before the multiplication of labor, the condition of possibility for the bodies of the speakers to be translated into differentiated labor power not for oneself across different labor regimes. Although happening across different historical junctures, across disparate geographies and in ways that are local and particular to their respective time and space, the translation aesthetics of the semiotic objects <i>mark as an event(s)</i> the experience(s) before bodies are separated from their own life and translated into (cheap) labor power. But the bodies are not all constructed as cheap labor that is equivalent to each other. Instead, Sandro Mezzadra points out that capitalism today functions through “continuous multiplication of control devices that correspond to the multiplication of labor regimes and the subjectivities,”<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> a multiplication that takes place before any <i>division</i> of labor can be imagined. It is in these multiple labor regimes where the commodity of labor power is exchanged; but because labor power is inextricable from the body, the control devices must perform an act of translation: they must establish a continuity at a site of discontinuity, the body as labor power that is no longer for itself but for the satisfaction of labor regimes where it finds itself inserted into. Once the subject is in the market, the “continuity and stability of production and reproduction of labor power”<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> can no longer be taken for granted. Translation aesthetics make the event before the multiplication of labor legible as a moment(s) when subjects contest the social and material conditions that will force their bodies into the commodity of labor power that supplies the demands of different labor regimes. Home-yet-to-come is thus one event, rendered legible through a translation aesthetics, that is an instance of the polymorphous event before the multiplication of labor, the condition of possibility for bodies to be translated into labor power, for the migrant as a subject of labor to even be imagined.

<div align="center"><h3>Conclusion: Universal Justice for the Body Separated from Labor Power for Itself</h3></div>
<p></p>
The scope of this project has been to make a wager that argues for the home-yet-to-come as an instance of contestations against threats to being in space, against the social and material conditions that will lead subjects within Honduras to migrate. Their contestation of the social and material conditions is also an instance of the event before the multiplication of labor, which is the condition of possibility for the continuation of global capitalism as it allows the appropriation of differentiated labor power from the subject(s) in transit. My project is a wager to make the event before the multiplication of labor legible as a political concern through a translation aesthetics in which semiotic objects employ translation as their structure not only to exist but also to reconstitute subjects and their social relations, in an attempt to claim for an alternative, universal justice. And whereas the specificities of this universal justice must wrestle with histories and particularities of specific locations in order to successfully address the threat to <i>being</i> (since capitalism updates itself to the particularities of space), there is a general direction this universal justice should aim for that exceeds the contemporary terms of political representation precisely because it is a justice concerned with the ability to exist in space. This universal justice that reconstitutes the political must seek to abolish the material and social conditions, embedded in patriarchal, racist, imperial and settler colonial logics, that make possible the violent multiplication of labor (a justice that disrupts the here-now), where life is translated as labor power no longer for the living body, but for the labor market.
