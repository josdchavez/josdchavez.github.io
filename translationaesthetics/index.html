<div align="center"><h3>Introduction: Reading <i>Dictar Y Recordar</i> For the Home-Yet-To-Come</h3></div>
<p></p>
What is in front of you is a wager to make recognizable an “event,” which may or may not “happen.” The communication of its existence is not guaranteed. By the end of your engagement with this site, my wager will be tested on your ability to recognize why the content itself is worthy of the noun I’m using to introduce it. “Event” is not used lightly as I am trying to convey magnitude, as a signifier for lived experience(s) discursively organized to rearrange History and Geography. In other words, this “event” is worthy of the name if it produces recognizable changes in how reality is perceived. Events are customarily recognized as such through proper names, in this case, the event is the home-yet-to-come. But before I spell out what this name refers to, I’d like to discuss “where” this “event” is taking place. The home-yet-to-come is possible to be thought of thanks to my translation of 10 memories collected and transcribed by artist Paul Ramirez Jonas.
<p></p>
Jonas executed in 2010 a performance installation piece called <i>Dictar Y Recordar</i>, at <i>La Mancha de Tomate</i>, an independent art space in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. For the performance, Jonas invited anyone in Tegucigalpa to come to the art space  and dictate memories of Honduras in an attempt to “do the impossible: write a complete history of Honduras<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>,” in the span of 24 hours. Imagine walking into a long and narrow room, stacks of papers held together and hanging against the wall thanks to clothespins and clothesline, allowing you to peruse through the documents: to read the words shaped after the map of Honduras, to take a look at the longer texts and to admire the drawings that accompany them. You see how the stacks grow, the wall gets more covered, as the day goes by.

<i>Scenes from the performance in 2010, documentation courtesy of artist</i>
                                                                  <p></p> 
Desks run along the walls of the narrow room, each covered by dark purple or blue tablecloths with type-recorders clinking away as volunteer typists listen to the recollections of participants. You walked in out of curiosity while strolling through the capital, but most of the people in the room are indigenous and non-indigenous, female and male activists from all over the country’s rural areas, arranged to be there by Jonas himself. His interest in writing a complete history of Honduras is linked to the country’s political instability, “a country that has almost as many governments as years of independence.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> This desire to write a “complete history,” Jonas confided to me while sharing dumplings at the community garden located on Elizabeth Street in New York City, is also informed by the political unrest that forced him, while growing up, to constantly move in between Pomona, CA and Honduras. The timing of the performance installation is also crucial: 2010 is merely a year after the coup of 2009, which the National Party staged in collaboration with the U.S. government against Liberal-Leftist, then-President, Manuel ‘Mel’ Zelaya. 
<p></p>
The coup prevented Zelaya’s contestation of a constitutional prohibition against running for a second term, which was instituted in the 1982 constitution in order to prevent the monopoly of power that characterized much of Honduran government soon after its independence from Spain and throughout the 19th and 20th century. Zelaya’s “challenge” to democracy was: printing a fourth question in the ballot boxes for general elections, asking people if they would allow him to run for a second term. It was unclear whether a “yes” would immediately result in overwriting the constitution or what exactly would happen after the results.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Zelaya had a support base that consisted mostly of the young, rural poor with varying support from urban residents of various socioeconomic levels. His rhetoric borrowed heavily from the revolutionary discourse of Marxist-inspired labor organizers that was popular and widespread throughout the country during the 1980s. He also increasingly became closer to Hugo Chavez, making his “connection” to “Communism” more obvious through an anti-U.S. imperialism sentiment. However, the executions of his “revolutionary” policies were mired with corruption scandals and lack of funds. His “revolutionary” stance was also constantly criticized based on his violent family history: Zelaya is member of a family of elite, rural landowners. His father, the family patriarch also named Manuel Zelaya, ordered the Horcones Massacre of 1975, in which 15 religious leaders, students, and campesinos were killed by the military while protesting against the Zelaya family land grabs of communal and indigenous land in Olancho, the Western part of Honduras.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> 
<p></p>
Zelaya’s polysemic position within a domestic/international landscape must be taken into account to appreciate how it is that his actions merited a coup that took place at an international scale: not only in terms of participants but also media coverage. Because of his close alliance with Venezuela and his espousing of leftist language, Zelaya must have represented a threat to the hegemonic world order spearheaded by the U.S., established in the region through traumatic violence during its occupation of Honduras to persecute “Communists” in the 80s. He revived tensions suppressed ever since the end of U.S. occupation in the 90s - silences and ellipses that constitute the geography of the globalized world today, lived experiences that have been prevented from reaching the category of “event,” a condition of possibility for migration and its labor from Honduras to be “cheap” for the U.S.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> By staging a coup, hegemonic world order was maintained. “Democracy” was “safeguarded” in order to ensure the condition of possibility for the proliferation of cheap labor. I do not mean to suggest that Zelaya staying in power was going to change the conditions of migration as source of cheap labor, but staying in power might have changed the direction of the labor from U.S. to other contesting powers for hegemony, the Venezuela of mid and late 2000s.
<p></p>
It is necessary to discuss Zelaya and the global relationships that precipitated his ousting because the home-yet-to-come becomes legible through the translation of stories that are narrating the speakers’ experiences during during the coup and how it elicited, in many of them, memories about the political persecution “Communist” activists experienced during the 80s. Jonas’s piece is interested in collection and transcription in order to create a history of a place. In transcribing and exhibiting the memories, Jonas creates an immersive space where history is alive through the circulation and representation of memories as an interactive archive. However, by insisting to package and present to an audience the stories as a "history" of a self-evident and clearly differentiated space known as "Honduras," Jonas' performance installation obscures the fluid geographical and temporal dynamics expressed within the stories. Seriously considering these dynamics might forces us to reframe the archive as a "history" of how the global present is constituted as is. This is where I’m incredibly grateful to Jonas for allowing me to use the material he gathered at my discretion. From the 140 stories collected, I have selected to translate and make digitally available 10 of them. The act of translating this stories demanded me to do historical research on the 2009 coup and Honduras under U.S. occupation during the 80s. It is through the translations and the research that footnotes each publicly accessible (and editable) entry that I hope to make legible an event: the experience of the home-yet-to-come as a structure of feeling in contemporary capitalist globalization that hinges upon the desire for change that secures the ability to reproduce one’s being in the world, a desire that happens right at the moment when the change itself is dissipating from the horizon of actualization.
<p></p>
I will come back to the home-yet-to-come, but at this moment is necessary to emphasize that Jonas’ piece misses the opportunity to circulate the stories in larger histories and geographies by insisting to understand the memories as a “national history” of a discrete, self-evident space called Honduras. But how can we more productively think of this signifier, “Honduras”? In Nandita Sharma’s argument against theories of globalization that conclude globalization results in “the loss of national sovereignty with the resultant destruction of democratic forms of governance<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>,” Sharma offers a useful account of how globalization and nation-states interact: “The problem with nationalist approaches to understanding issues of state sovereignty and capitalist power lies in the assumption that sometime before this period of globalization nation states were actually sovereign...Regarding national states as having once been sovereign simply belies the historical record of how state practices have been a part of, and not a populist response against global capitalist social relations.”<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Rather than understanding “Honduras” as a sovereign nation, it is more productive to think of “Honduras” as a signifier for how state practices participate in the institutionalization and materialization of global capitalism in a specific geographic region, an undertaking that becomes highly productive given the position of the post-coup government: “Honduras is open for business.”<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>
<p></p>
Honduras as a way to refer to state practices institutionalizing and materializing global capitalism could not be more fitting given what happened this past January when Juan Orlando Hernandez was sworn into his second presidential term. Such sentence should puzzle the reader given our discussion on Zelaya: Hernandez, eight years later, managed to do the exact same thing Zelaya tried to do. Despite confirmed associations with the international drug trade, despite accusations of power consolidation across governmental branches, despite international organizations warning about the high possibility of electoral fraud and the intense rioting of a big sector of the population against a second term (Fuera JOH<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> has been ringing through the streets since December 2017) - despite all of this, the closest U.S. ally in the War on Drugs in Central America has been allowed to continue in power and further policies that are oriented to benefit the market, to facilitate an appropriation of resources (both in terms of land and people) to be managed for the market through the entity of “Honduras.” A bulk of his policies focus on infrastructure and urbanization, with Hong Kong and Singapore as models for “cities of the future”<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> that need to be emulated, an emphasis that reflects the current mode of accumulation by dispossession, urbanization itself. Therefore, the 2009 coup can be retroactively understood as facilitating capitalist accumulation, a facilitation that has been secured and sedimented through Hernandez’s second term and its focus on urbanization as way to actualize “economic development,” which is the same as saying “to facilitate the preferred mode of capitalist accumulation in the current historical juncture.” Instead of threatening the hegemonic world order, Hernandez was allowed to stay precisely because he upholds and furthers it through the openness to the current market of planetary urbanization.
<p></p>
By shifting what "Honduras" refers to, I’m suggesting that the memories gathered by Jonas are more than pages in a history book of a country. The stories probe into what it feels like to live through the contradictions of capitalist globalization and the desires that take place as the contradictions are lived and understood at the level of feeling. The stories can collectively be seen as conceptually making legible the event of the home-yet-to-come, an experience of waiting and getting ready for the emancipatory change that will allow one to finally feel at a “home” where one can imagine oneself into the future.  How this event arises from the translation of the stories and the memories they recount is the concern of the next section. But before that, below you will find the 10 translations with their respective footnotes and the original text. Please browse through the stories before you continue reading. Feel free to offer alternative translations or suggestions by making changes on the Google Docs themselves. Any alteration will be reviewed before approval.

<div align="center"><h3>The “Arrival” of the Home-Yet-to-Come: A Close-Reading of Select Stories from Jonas’ <i>Dictar Y Recordar</i>
</h3></div>
<p></p>
All of the texts translated describe events around the 2009 coup or similar memories of persevering through political tumultuousness that threatened the speakers’ existence in space. The act of translation has allowed me to close-read for a structure of feeling that might be able to describe what the stories are collectively aspiring for in the context of their experience of capitalist globalization, which the 2009 coup and the U.S occupation of Honduras in the 80s are manifestations of.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> This structure of feeling is also the event my translation is betting on making discernible: the experience of the home-yet-to-come as an active longing for (emancipatory) change that was perceived as on the way to its realization but was violently interrupted, thus exacerbating the threat to the body, the very condition that the desired change was imagined to address. The stories come from a cross-section of society, which allows me to also point out that the home-yet-to-come is differently experienced by the speakers in relation to their construction as subjects within the spectrum of Honduran humanity, which influences the ways in which speakers also narrate a sense of a “provisional home” through sociality that allows one to <i>live</i> through the precarity of the everyday while waiting for the home-yet-to-come.
<p></p>
The experience of the home-yet-to-come is an attempt to describe and think seriously the enunciation of a desire for change in the face of violence to the body. Let’s take a look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uHqGn_OkoQ6bfFcmvGNzPF6HwUtx-UEHrVWUb50Nwfc/edit?usp=sharing">Carlos</a>. His account takes place in October of 2009, when Zelaya managed to sneak back into the country after he was ousted and “holed up” at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa to prevent Honduran authorities from arresting him.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> While there, Zelaya was surrounded by his supporters, members of social movement La Resistencia, which Carlos is a part of. His account mirrors the viscerally-felt turmoil through the very way in which he recounts the violence experienced. Every time he mentions what it felt like to be under tear gas attack or to have the military aim sonic weapons at them, Carlos uses the phrase “at that moment.” Its repetition comes to function almost as a sign, constantly pointing back the reader to the very corporeal aspect of the experience that cannot be conveyed by language alone. There’s an urgency in Carlos repetition, most noticeable seen in the Spanish through the lack of punctuation: his sentences keep going and going, comma after comma, in an attempt to make present the serious threat posed to his being. However, this urgency is never a way Carlos victimizes himself, as even when his body was on the verge of expulsion from the world, the lesson he learned was: “In the end we substantiated something we already knew: the struggle was going to be tough; despite fear, it has to be fought if we want to see our country change.” In using “country,” Carlos frames his desire for change in relation to the physical space that is threatening his very being. What he is willing to fight for is this ability to <i>be</i>, the desire at the center of the experience of the home-yet-to-come.
<p></p>
Although the home-yet-to-come is enunciated from the point of view of supporters of la Resistencia, the event itself refers to a visceral desire for a change that is not tied with any particular existing political vision. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iI04x1ekIpSHCCnVC4U0mt1xDX-6cWN-sHh_2U_u5fg/edit?usp=sharing">Anonymous 11</a> is helpful in this regards as it is an account that expresses a desire for change in the home/country without taking an explicit support of La Resistencia as a political movement but still longing to address the violence to its supporters. Anonymous 11 describes what happened right after the coup when Zelaya had not yet managed to sneak back into Honduras and instead was in Nicaragua taunting authorities by stepping back-and-forth between the boundary separating the two countries.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>  Anonymous 11 is a stark contrast in terms of how the events are narrated: the tone is matter-of-fact, almost detached. This might be related to their different subject positions: Carlos is enacting the struggle, while Anonymous 11 is an “observer.” The ability to observe the struggle rather than be in it requires an ontological  security that is reflected in how Anonymous 11 got there: “I traveled in a vehicle that held international journalists, and for that reason, the military and police we ran into on our way there did not try to stop us.”  In their proximity to mechanisms that produce transnational commodities such as news, Anonymous 11 can claim a more certain being in the world which allows them to “witness” but not enough to name themselves (the speaker decided to stay anonymous for a reasons of safety). Regardless of this ability to claim proximity to ontological being, the desire for a change is still there, as seen not only by the moments of symbolic acts of  solidarity (singing the national anthem after finding Magdiel’s dead body) but also in how the story ends: “I left the place by noon in the same way I had arrived, but many were left stranded by the coup government that decreed through national broadcast a state of siege for El Paraiso...people could not move back to their places of origin because the police prevented them. I know this because I personally went to the police station in Danli, and there they had detained women, children and men they found on the road.”  A desire for change is expressed not because Anonymous 11 is explicitly supporting Zelaya and La Resistencia, but because the current social conditions prevent a reproduction of being in the world for certain bodies within the geographic space known as Honduras.
<p></p>
Thus, home-yet-to-come refers to the experience of an active longing for a change that is concerned not with a particular vision of politics, but rather for the sake of the body and its ability to be in the world. Furthermore, the desired change is one that was or seemed to be <i>on its way</i> to actualization but was prevented from doing so. The 2009 coup happened in the middle of preparations for a constitutional change: the ability for Zelaya to run a second term. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWwqO-ve9VRbedT3mRe0QImsZgARdfLI3Edao3FWlIE/edit?usp=sharing">Carmen's</a> account starts three days before the coup when Congress and military confiscated ballots and ballot boxes that contained Zelaya’s controversial fourth question: should there be a referendum on the constitution to allow a president to run a second term? Carmen vividly describes how she and other supporters of “la cuarta urna” (the fourth ballot box referendum) gathered in front of the Presidential Palace, how Zelaya lead them to the army base in the outskirts of the city to take away the ballot boxes and how they organized themselves to distribute the boxes throughout the country without the help of Congress. Carmen dwells on the details as a way to underline the people’s active participation in a change they considered necessary to improve their material conditions. Doing so also turns the moment when the coup succeeded into a moment of heartbreak and sorrow: “We spent the night like that - sad, afraid and cold. At dawn, disoriented people, as if suddenly our dreams of justice and liberty had been stolen.” “Stolen” criminalizes that lack of change and places it within an economy of agency: it is not that the change that allows for the body to continue <i>being</i> in the world simply disappeared. Instead, someone or something actively prevented it from becoming a reality, someone took it away despite Carmen’s and other people’s labor. 
<p></p>
At this point some might be wondering why is it that I’m utilizing the framework of “home” when none of the stories discussed so far have referred to the location of where the desire for change takes place as such.  Instead, they have referred to this desire for change in relation to a country, to Honduras. While the stories narrate to themselves a desire for change through a national framework, what they are really trying to describe is the universal and visceral experience of needing to feel at home somewhere, with Honduras/country being the basic unit with which this feeling is understood as being possible. Such longing for home that gets territorialized within the imaginary space of the nation comes to the fore with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJnanJxyixnX2Ry4s6_wwKzaV-O_YEiN2OppZjVA1aY/edit?usp=sharing">Jorge</a>, who recounts how he ran away from home at the age of 17 to go work at a bar in California before returning to Honduras for Zelaya’s inauguration address. California was important to Jorge’s ability to <i>be</i> in the world: “Because I lived in California I learned how to calm down, to relax and to see the world not as a challenge but as a place full of opportunities where goals can be reached and dreams can be achieved with some sacrifice.” Learning how to “calm down” and to “relax,” both verbs that refer to the body, becomes crucial when Jorge returns to Honduras and experiences suicidal thoughts. The fact that he must leave Honduras to learn how to “relax” suggests that the change desired is for one that will allow Jorge to feel relaxed in Honduras instead of the sinking despair that gets exacerbated with the coup:  “each day the destiny, the palate and the reality of this people who made me who I am (and who I think of with every step I take) is going to change, even if I don’t move to the front or to the back but instead each time I feel ‘hondo Honduras.” Jorge ends his account believing in the urgency of change, a change needed even if he feels “hondo Honduras"<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> - sinking in deeper depths, deep in Honduras. But in contrasting this sinking despair in Honduras with the ability to be relaxed in California, Jorge’s account suggests that what the change desired for is really about is about making the body feel at home on a given physical space. 
<p></p>
Understanding the stories as narrating a certain experience of longing for the home that was <i>on its way</i> but was prevented from doing so (home-yet-to-come) allows us to tease out the visceral and universal desire for ontological security that home is a figure for. Ofelia Cuevas’ article “Welcome to My Cell” offers us a way to understand how home functions as “a precondition for any meaningful conception of personhood, for without the future, the self dissolves into the evanescence of an eternally fragmented present.”<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> The desire for the country (the home) to change is a desire to feel “‘ontological security,’ the state of emotive well-being and constancy necessary for developing a stable personal identity.”<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> The desire for home is a desire for an experience of <i>being here</i> that allows the “I” to imagine existing in the future. Vilem Flusser also suggests the importance of satisfying this desire when he writes, “Without a home, I would be unconscious, that is, without a home, I would not actually exist. A home is how I find myself in the world - if at all. It is primary.”<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> Therefore, home can be understood as a shorthand to refer to the feeling of belonging to a space that allows the subject who imagines themselves at home to project their desires into the future in a way that perpetuates their <i>being</i>.
<p></p>
If home is understood in such a way, “Honduras” (both the imagined sovereign nation and the state practices that institutionalize and materialize global capitalism) has failed to upheld its promise as the imagined unit (home = nation) where belonging <i>ought</i> to take place. Honduras as a home is a promise that has not been actualized which is why the speakers engage in the different actions they describe, in order to make this promise (where belonging aligns with body and space) come true. This very feeling, regardless of the contents that are seemed as able to fulfil the promise (Zelaya winning the referendum, Zelaya leaving the country, Zelaya returning etc..) is what the home-yet-to-come highlights in order to make a demand for different forms of justice. The home-yet-to-come is useful to be read in relation to Derrida’s coinage of “messianicity without messianism.” He developed the idea in his 1993 book <i>Specters of Marx</i>, which was written after the global collapse of communism. In arguing how the “spirit of Marx” is even more relevant after the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall (one must also remember this would be after the persecutions of “Communists” under U.S. occupied Honduras), Derrida posed messianicity as a way to talk about the structure of the experience of the “emancipatory promise” that does not rely on any messianicisms (any content such as Christianity, Marxism, Democracy, Communism, etc...) but instead as “a certain experience of the promise that one can try to liberate from any dogmatics and even from any metaphysico-religious determination, from any messianism. And a promise must promise to be kept, that is, not to remain "spiritual" or "abstract, but to produce events, new effective forms of action, practice, organization, and so forth.”<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> Home-yet-to-come can be seen as participating in the structure of messianicity without messianism insofar as it is a way to highlight the experience of desire for an emancipation one was actively preparing to actualize, but whose possibility of being was suddenly interrupted. This interruption threatens the very ability for the body to exist in space. It is because the desire for change is motivated by the threat to being in space that the home-yet-to-come demands new “events, new effective forms of action, practice, organization.” The very existence of the desire is a signifier that the promise has not been met, that the body’s ability to <i>be</i> is still threatened, that the home has yet to come.
<p></p>
But it is not merely that home-yet-to-come underlines this desire that points to how the body is still threatened. The desire’s existence also opens up time and space to how the body has been threatened, how the justice for the present needs to be haunted by the ghosts of these threats. Derrida postulates that messianicity “mandates that we interrupt the ordinary course of things, time and history here-now; it is inseparable from an affirmation of otherness and justice.”<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> This interruption of the “here-now” takes place through an “exorcism” that allows the haunting of ghosts, “not in order to chase away the ghosts, but this time to grant them the right, if it means making them come back alive.”<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> Ghosts can be said to abound in the translated accounts if we understand by ghosts the presence of memories beyond 2009 - the ways in which the coup activate memories of political persecution during the U.S. occupation of Honduras in the 80s. Ghosts figure quite explicitly in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZXJrGTS8FyfyiVyfKJ5cpIavZB058G2Dje6gRnSyqrc/edit?usp=sharing">Nora's</a> account. Nora feels 2009 as a failure of the actualization of the emancipatory promise embodied by Zelaya just how she felt the failure of labor organizing she engaged in during the 80s. Nora narrates how this pain almost drove her to suicide (her attempted suicide is narrated as taken place on the same date as the coup but three or four years later). She ends her story with an apparition: “In the crowd I saw Fidel Martinez, Tomas Nativi and so many of the compas who I only knew by their pseudonyms. They all got lost in the crowd. At the end, I ran into Francisco Morazan, who, riding a horse with sword in hand, was seeing us and taking attendance. When walking past me, I held my posture and said to him: “General, here we are present...Patria or death, my general” Tomas Nativi and Fidel Martinez are the names of leftist activists from Honduras who “disappeared” (a.k.a. were successfully silenced/murdered by the U.S.-Honduras state). Their “presence” links the coup with the U.S. occupation of Honduras: two moments when the desire for emancipation perseveres despite the foreclosure of the emancipation itself. Nora conjures her disappeared comrades (she was working in leftist organizing alongside with them during the 80s) as soldiers presenting themselves to Morazan, one of the most respected Presidents of Honduras who tried to establish a Central American Federation in the 1800s. In presenting herself to Morazan as a soldier ready to die, Nora conjures Morazan as a judge, as a figure that represents the honor of what her imagined home is. This allows Nora to demand a form of justice that takes the sacrifice of her comrades into account, a justice that disrupts the here-now through the very way in which the here-now is understood, not as static present but as full of ghosts. Respectively, Honduras in 2017, the Honduras that is opened for business, is not a result of the justice of democracy, is not the emancipatory promise but in fact another instance where ghosts are needed to demand new visions of justice.
