<p>well hello<br>
i'm a rising senior at columbia university, majoring in comparative literature with spanish and mandarin as my languages of study. 
  currently interning with <a href="http://www.chinaresidencies.com">ChinaResidencies</a>, an online directory for art residencies in china. throughout the summer i will be
interviewing artists and residency directors about their residency experience as well as reading project proposals as jury for china residencies' open call.</p>
<p>two projects that i'm currently working on: 
<br>
~ interactive maps - a group of my classmates and i are working together with 
prof. anupama rao to create interactive, digital maps to accompany the english translation of Dalit activist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._B._More">r.b. more's</a> memoir,
  a text that illuminates the intertwined histories of bombay's urban development and its dependence on dalit social life and labor. 
<br>
~ a speculative non-fiction digital collage - editing a piece i wrote that will be published on <a href="http://adanewmedia.org/">ada: a journal of new media, gender & technology</a>
  about activist-poet <a href="http://primeratormenta.blogspot.com">susana chavez</a> and the blog she left online after her <a href="http://newamericamedia.org/2011/01/not-one-more---susana-chavezs-death-sparks-outrage-in-juarez.php">murder</a> in 2011. the piece is an essay in the form of 
  an interactive website with screencaps of chavez's "posthumous" blog.
