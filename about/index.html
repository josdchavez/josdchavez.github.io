<p>well hello<br>
i'm a rising senior at columbia university, majoring in comparative literature with spanish and mandarin as my languages of study. 
currently interning with chinaresidencies.com, an online directory for art residencies in china. throughout the summer i will be
interviewing artists and residency directors about their residency experience as well as reading project proposals as jury for china residencies' open call.</p>
<p>two other projects that i'm currently working on: 
<br>
1) a translation project of an autobiography of a Dalit activist from mumbai, r.b. more. a group of my classmates and i are working together with 
prof. anupama rao to create interactive, digital maps to tell r.b. more's story along with the history of bombay and dalit activism.
<br>
2) been thinking a lot on dams + canals in central america, death and development. berta caceres was murdered for 
protesting a dam that many powerful economic players were supporting to be built on the territory of the Lenca people. the interoceanic canal that a hong kong company is planning to build in nicaragua will contaminate
the largest source of drinkable water in central america, destroy unique ecosystems and dispossess mostly rural, indigenous people. the very little i've recently seen of contemporary art from central america has got me thinking about this. </p>
