<p>well hello<br>i'm a rising senior at columbia university, majoring in comparative literature with spanish and mandarin as my languages of study. 
currently interning with ChinaResidencies.com, an online directory for art residencies in china. throughout the summer i will be
publishing interviews with various artists and residency directors where we discuss their residency experience in order to help
artists who are researching for opportunities to work in China to make informed decisions. i also hope, however, that these interviews
might be a way to think about current infrastructures for art to reach a transnational audience/circulation, 
a space to facilitate acccessibility to opportunities (especially for marginalized artists) and even perhaps a place 
to start imagining a South-South art community.</p>

<p>two other projects that i'm excited about and currently working on: 
<br>1) a translation project of an autobiography of a Dalit activist from Mumbai, r.b. more. The "translation" I'm doing is 
from history to mapping technology. A group of my classmates and i are working together with 
prof. anupama rao to create interactive, digital maps to accompany the translation of r.b more's biography into english. thinking
through the mapping technology in order to translate the biography in a way that produces knowledge that wouldn't 
be possible through just a book.<br>
2) been thinking a lot on dams + canals in central america, death and development. berta caceres was murdered for 
protesting a dam that many powerful economic players were supporting to be built on the territory of the Lenca people, an 
indigenous group in honduras. the interoceanic canal that a hong kong company is planning to built in nicaragua will contaminate
the largest source of drinkable water, destroy unique ecosystems and dispossess mostly rural, indigenous people in the poorest
parts of nicaragua. don't know much about guatemala, el salvador or costa rica. i barely know anything about central american art. but it
is the very scarce contemporary art from central america that i've recently seen that has made me think about this.</p> 
<br>3) after doing some independent curation in shanghai, been trying to get going here in new york. item 2 (hehe) is where 
my curation thoughts are currently going into. will update when there's something more. if you got anything you want to share about 
this, lmk ! (i.e positive thoughts, recs, a contact, etc).</p>
